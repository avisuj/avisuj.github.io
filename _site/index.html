            Journeying with God: Navigating the Absence of Prophets and Embracing Active Faith

        </h3>
        <h5</h5>In this personal reflection, I explore the Gospel reading from Mark, contemplating the intriguing image of God as a traveler and pondering the absence of new prophets in my Catholic faith. I delve into the roles of the Holy Spirit, the anticipation of Christ's return, and my responsibility to actively bring Heaven to Earth.</li><li><span class="post-meta">Aug 13, 2023 --&nbsp; <a href="/categories/faith">faith</a></span>

            A Journey of Faith and Community
          </a>
        </h3>
        <h5</h5>In my journey towards the Rite of Acceptance with the Catholic Church, I reflect on how taking up the cross of Christ and embracing His teachings has shaped my life. Moments like a transformative retreat experience and a surprising encounter with Pope John Paul II highlighted the power of God's love and the unity of the Catholic community. As I delve deeper into my faith, I grapple with the call to carry the cross, embrace communal teachings, and discern divine inspiration, finding solace and strength in the enduring embrace of faith.</li><li><span class="post-meta">Aug 13, 2023 --&nbsp; <a href="/categories/integrity">integrity</a>&nbsp; <a href="/categories/heart">heart</a>&nbsp; <a href="/categories/parenting">parenting</a></span>

          </a>
        </h3>
        <h5</h5>I explore the intriguing question of why people hold differing moral judgments. Drawing inspiration from Daniel Pink's observations, I delve into the diversity of moral values and the role of personal identity. Through the lens of the Moral Foundations theory and insights from Brene Brown, I examine how conscious cultivation of core values can strengthen identity, guide ethical decisions, and offer a resilient foundation in overcoming life's challenges.</li><li><span class="post-meta">Aug 4, 2023 --&nbsp; <a href="/categories/integrity">integrity</a>&nbsp; <a href="/categories/heart">heart</a>&nbsp; <a href="/categories/parenting">parenting</a></span>

Being present with my family and executing plans with a positive mindset have helped me grow and set an example for my children.</li><li><span class="post-meta">Jun 18, 2023 --&nbsp; <a href="/categories/integrity">integrity</a>&nbsp; <a href="/categories/legacy">legacy</a>&nbsp; <a href="/categories/heart">heart</a>&nbsp; <a href="/categories/parenting">parenting</a></span>

By breaking down goals into smaller tasks, embracing change, collaborating, and reflecting, we can better adapt to unknowns and live our best lives.</li><li><span class="post-meta">Feb 18, 2023 --&nbsp; <a href="/categories/integrity">integrity</a>&nbsp; <a href="/categories/heart">heart</a>&nbsp; <a href="/categories/legacy">legacy</a>&nbsp; <a href="/categories/parenting">parenting</a></span>

        <h5</h5>This post explores the true sources of value in human life, distinguishing between innate value, which is rooted in our humanity and connections with others, and bestowed value, which is based on economic or social status. I argue that appreciating and valuing each person as God-given is key to recognizing and honoring our own innate worth and that of others.</li><li><span class="post-meta">Jan 2, 2023 --&nbsp; <a href="/categories/integrity">integrity</a>&nbsp; <a href="/categories/heart">heart</a></span>

        </h3>
        <h5</h5>My post on the new year doesn't adequately capture the frustration I feel around 2022.  I did the right things but indicators around my health are neutral at best.  Compared to 2021, I was 45% more active.  How is it that you can exercise more yet have many of the signals of your cardio vascular age (hrv, cholesterol, lipids) fall out of control?</li></ul></div>
