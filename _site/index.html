            The Dual Nature of Human Thinking: Integrating Intuition and Deliberation for Success
          </a>
        </h3>
        <h5</h5>The blog post discusses the concept of 'Giving an A' from the book 'The Art of Possibility' by Rosamund Stone Zander and Benjamin Zander, and how it relates to the dual modes of thinking in the brain. Embracing both fast, intuitive, and emotional thinking and slower, deliberative, and logical thinking is important for learning and growth.</li><li><span class="post-meta">Apr 8, 2023 --&nbsp; <a href="/categories/integrity">integrity</a>&nbsp; <a href="/categories/heart">heart</a>&nbsp; <a href="/categories/technology">technology</a></span>

            Exploring the Intersection of AI and Human Values: Opportunities, Challenges, and Ethics
          </a>
        </h3>
        <h5</h5>This blog post explores the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and human values, including the benefits and risks of AI, the impact of AI on human qualities and dignity, and the importance of ethical AI. It discusses the potential of AI to augment human capabilities, but also the need to ensure that AI is aligned with human interests and values and does not cause harm or injustice. Ultimately, it highlights the dynamic and evolving nature of human qualities and the role of technology in shaping them, and calls for a responsible and reflective approach to the design, development, and use of AI systems.</li><li><span class="post-meta">Apr 7, 2023 --&nbsp; <a href="/categories/integrity">integrity</a>&nbsp; <a href="/categories/parenting">parenting</a></span>

            Living an Agile Life: Coping with Unknown Unknowns
          </a>
        </h3>
        <h5</h5>This blog post explores the concept of unknown unknowns and how they can impact our lives. It discusses the agile methodology as a way of coping with uncertainties and achieving personal goals. By breaking down goals into smaller tasks, embracing change, collaborating, and reflecting, we can better adapt to unknowns and live our best lives.</li><li><span class="post-meta">Feb 18, 2023 --&nbsp; <a href="/categories/integrity">integrity</a>&nbsp; <a href="/categories/heart">heart</a>&nbsp; <a href="/categories/legacy">legacy</a>&nbsp; <a href="/categories/parenting">parenting</a></span>

            Unpacking the Meaning of Value: Why Innate Worth Outlasts Job Titles
          </a>
        </h3>
        <h5</h5>This post explores the true sources of value in human life, distinguishing between innate value, which is rooted in our humanity and connections with others, and bestowed value, which is based on economic or social status. I argue that appreciating and valuing each person as God-given is key to recognizing and honoring our own innate worth and that of others.</li><li><span class="post-meta">Jan 2, 2023 --&nbsp; <a href="/categories/integrity">integrity</a>&nbsp; <a href="/categories/heart">heart</a></span>

            Frustrated with My Health; Trying to Trust The Process
          </a>
        </h3>
        <h5</h5>My post on the new year doesn't adequately capture the frustration I feel around 2022.  I did the right things but indicators around my health are neutral at best.  Compared to 2021, I was 45% more active.  How is it that you can exercise more yet have many of the signals of your cardio vascular age (hrv, cholesterol, lipids) fall out of control?</li><li><span class="post-meta">Dec 20, 2022 --&nbsp; <a href="/categories/integrity">integrity</a>&nbsp; <a href="/categories/investing">investing</a>&nbsp; <a href="/categories/legacy">legacy</a>&nbsp; <a href="/categories/tech">tech</a></span>

          </a>
        </h3>
        <h5</h5>I wouldn't do 2022 differently, but there are definitely some changes I want to take into 2023.  Over the year, we made some great memories.  Financially, we were even with the market.  Given the market stress and significant one time expenses, I'm impressed with how our new budgeting system is working.  I wish we would have adopted it sooner.</li><li><span class="post-meta">Nov 21, 2022 --&nbsp; <a href="/categories/faith">faith</a>&nbsp; <a href="/categories/heart">heart</a></span>

        <h5</h5>We recently lost a friend.  More importantly our friends lost a father and a husband.  In this post, I explore how the living try to continue the journey with love and compassion.</li><li><span class="post-meta">Jun 4, 2022 --&nbsp; <a href="/categories/faith">faith</a>&nbsp; <a href="/categories/heart">heart</a></span>

        </h3>
        <h5</h5>It's easy to get lost in a meme.  It's easy to respond to snark with sarcasm.  It's much harder to learn from those that disagree with you.  It's harder to listen with curiosity.  In this blog post I talk about how I use mental models to deconstruct labels into implied values.  By staying curious, by leveraging the Holy Spirit to listen, I think my life is more rewarding because I can search for God in others and turn them into my teachers.</li><li><span class="post-meta">Apr 16, 2022 --&nbsp; <a href="/categories/faith">faith</a>&nbsp; <a href="/categories/parenting">parenting</a></span>

        </h3>
        <h5</h5>In Communion, I talk about my faith journey.  Specifically I try to answer: +Why I chose Catholicism when my wife was Episcopal and my mother was Hindu? +If I'm leading my children to be Catholic, why have I not gotten baptized? +How do I resolve my liberal beliefs around abortion and homosexuality with the Catechism of the Church?</li><li><span class="post-meta">Apr 11, 2022 --&nbsp; <a href="/categories/heart">heart</a>&nbsp; <a href="/categories/integrity">integrity</a>&nbsp; <a href="/categories/legacy">legacy</a></span>

        <h5</h5>I work through a mental block that I have around empathizing with other's illness.  I talk about how my personality, and my past contribute to that block and I discuss hopes I have for changing my behavior in the future.</li></ul></div>
