excerpt: "This is my prayer as a Catholic father trying to love well in a space that feels heavy and sacred. My daughter is exploring same-sex attraction, and while I hold to the truth of the Church’s teaching, I also know I’m called to love her with patience, kindness, and all the fruits of the Spirit. I believe she is a child of God, and if she draws closer to Him—even partially—I want to celebrate that. I’m learning that truth must be spoken in love, and love must be spoken in a way it can be received. I can’t control her journey, and that’s a kind of suffering I have to bear. But I believe God is present in the tension. My hope is to live this love with conviction and tenderness, trusting that God’s grace will do what I cannot.

**Lord—**

I’ve been sitting with the weight of my vocation: to be a Catholic father and husband, entrusted with a daughter exploring questions of identity and same-sex attraction.

Here’s what I know:  
I am called to love her.  
Not conditionally. Not strategically. Not when it’s easy.  
**Love *is* patient.**  
**Love *is* kind.**  
Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.

And love doesn’t erupt in confrontation every time it encounters difference. It listens. It grieves. It stays.  
The fruits of the Spirit—**love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness,** and **self-control**—must become more than words for me. Let them become my posture.

My daughter is Your daughter.  
If she draws near to You—even imperfectly, even partially—I will rejoice.  
I know she may not yet live in full alignment with the moral teachings of Your Church.  
But I believe Your grace is present and working, even in ambiguity.  
You meet us in fragments and draw us toward fullness.  
And communion—any real connection to You—is always a gift worth honoring.

Your Ascension reminds me:  
Division is easy. Unity is hard.  
But You didn’t say, “Go and sort the righteous from the rest.”  
You said, **“That they may be one.”**

Help me remember:  
Truth must be spoken in love.  
And love must be spoken in a way it can be heard.

This is like sales, strangely enough.  
It’s not enough to know the value.  
You have to communicate it in a way the other person can hear.  
Otherwise, you’re just talking to yourself.

So I accept that my daughter’s journey may feel like partial communion.  
And that may be a kind of suffering I bear quietly.  
But I will bear it *with* You.  
I believe what the Church teaches about sexuality and the human person is true and good—even when it’s hard.  
And I trust that Your truth will always be more compelling when wrapped in tenderness than when wielded as a weapon.

You write straight with crooked lines.  
Your ways are not mine.  
Your grace is patient.  
And You are at work.

I don’t carry this alone.  
You are with me.  
You will give me the grace to testify to truth in ways that unite, not divide.  
That heal, not harden.  
That strengthen, not shame.

I love You, God.  
And I love my child.  
Help me live that love with courage, patience, and joy.  
And keep working on me.  
There’s more I need to learn, and more You want to teach.

**Amen.**
