excerpt: "I wrote this as a prayer in a moment where everything felt like too much. My daughter, who now wants to be called Alexander, is wrestling with identity and truth in ways that challenge me to respond with both conviction and compassion. I don’t have it figured out—at 45, I still struggle with obedience and pride myself. But today I chose to engage, to say: you are loved, even when we don’t agree. I’m drawing strength from examples like Fr. Mike Schmitz and creating space through things like teaching Isaac’s religious education at home, where I hope Xander will join us. This isn’t a battlefield—it’s sacred ground. And in all of it, my prayer remains: stay close, Lord. I need Your voice to find my way home."

Lord, right now—it feels like too much.
I’m trying to hold truth and love in the same hand,
to neither condone nor condemn,
to stay in the tension without unraveling.

My daughter wants to be called Alexander now. She believes truth is real, but she thinks it should adapt to her own understanding rather than remain rooted in something eternal. She sees faith as something flexible, meant to bend to her preferences. It hurts deeply to watch her wrestle with pride, knowing how it steals the humility that could grant her peace.

Yet, who am I to judge? At 45, I still find myself stumbling when asked to surrender my own will to Yours. Obedience remains a constant challenge. I'm living in a glass house—fully aware of my own flaws, unable to cast stones.

Today, I chose to engage rather than remain silent. I gently reminded her that she will always be loved and she will always be family and my love doesn't mean I agree with every choice she makes. It felt like a small step, but it was a necessary foothold in uncertain terrain.

I'm drawing strength from Fr. Mike Schmitz, whose unwavering love for his brother, despite profound differences, inspires me. His ability to hold onto truth and love simultaneously gives me hope.

I've also decided to teach Isaac’s religious education at home, and I anticipate Xander will join us. I see this as sacred ground—not a battlefield, but a meeting place. A chance for genuine connection without power struggles, where presence matters more than persuasion.

I deeply believe You're not finished with any of us yet. So, my prayer remains simple and urgent:

Stay close, Lord. Like a lost sheep, I need to hear Your voice clearly—to find my way back home.

Amen
