excerpt: "Over the last two weeks, I've been dealing with a depression flare-up.  Having been aware of depression for half my life, I understand how I experience the condition.  As a next step in this relationship, I'm sharing to exert ownership over this disease I live with."

As I awake this morning, my eyes are wet and my chest is heavy.  I feel like I've been crying for a week; which I have been.  Two weeks ago, my daughter caught Covid-19 from school.  We were expecting it - she went to a school band lock-in; with a concentration of middle-schoolers indoors it seemed inevitable.  I ended up showing symptoms on March 4th.  Fortunately, our entire experience of Covid-19 has been mild and we tested negative for it yesterday.  I didn't expect that I'd get caught up in a depression flare-up.

I was diagnosed with depression when I was 16.  I've been on and off medication five times in my life; recently accepting that I will always need medication to help manage the physical symptoms of the disorder.  My mental photographs of childhood center around meltdowns:  
- There was the time I let my brother take the fall for me for creating a mess in the dining room.  He got spanked; I got the shame.
- There was the time when my dad was consoling me through uncontrollable sadness while visiting a family in Ohio.
- There was the time when I got invited to the cool kids birthday party and I awkwardly stood out.  I blamed my parents for that with white hot anger that reflected into personal shame.  What kind of child carries that kind of anger?
- There was the time when I was committed to the hospital for suicide watch.  That moment was wondrous shame mix - I was ashamed of having a condition; I was ashamed of being on medication; and I was ashamed of getting rejected by a girl.  

According to Mayo Clinic, "Depression is a mood disorder that causes persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest. . . Recent research indicates that changes in the function and effect of these neurotransmitters and how they interact with neurocircuits involved in maintaining mood stability may play a significant role in depression and its treatment."  I remember studying facilitated transport in biology - I picture myself short on receptors for Serotonin.  Simon Sinek writes: "Serotonin is the feeling of pride. It is the feeling we get when we perceive that others like or respect us. It makes us feel strong and confident, like we can take on anything. . . Serotonin is attempting to reinforce the bond between parent and child, teacher and student, coach and player, boss and employee, leader and follower."  

I have a condition that encourages me to carry shame instead of pride; to focus on sadness instead of happiness; to embrace grief instead of connection.  I suspect my mental photographs reflect this tendency.  It's easier for me to recall sadness.  The medication I'm on to treat depression is a selective Serotonin re-uptake inhibitor.  It helps me balance shame with pride and sadness with joy.

As I've gotten older, it has become easier for me to tell when I'm driving my life or if my disorder is.  When I'm struggling with Serotonin deficiency:
- I will be quick to anger; often being viewed by others as mercurial in disagreements.
- I will be overwhelmed by negative self-talk.  I will only see disaster and destruction around me.
- I will isolate myself to hide my shame.

Emotions do not exist in a vacuum; in the past I've struggled with my disorder in moments of change in my environment.  For example, with this flare-up:
- Spring has been unseasonably late
- Ukraine has been invaded by Russia
- My family caught Covid-19

The trigger for this episode was the death of a fictional character.  Last week, while I was sick I binged on the Divergent series.  In the last book, the heroine of this war-ravaged world dies saving it in an act of loving self-sacrifice.  Veronica Roth comments "In each book she [the heroine] tried to emulate her parents sacrifice [her parents died saving her life], and in each book she didn't seem to understand what sacrifice really was until Allegiant.  And it's only in Allegiant when she has a strong sense of identity, when she had a keen understanding of what she believed about selflessness, that her journey was over."

I'm not sad because I'm displacing my life onto the heroine's.  While I read the book as part of an effort to escape the feeling of hopelessness associated with the Ukraine war, I recognize that the book is fiction; that it's an escape.  I'm sad because at this moment I'm predisposed to only see the loss.  For me, that is depression - reacting in an unreasonable way because I'm temporarily blinded from the beauty of life.  I know it's there but I can't see it and in my blindness I embrace things I do see; shame, grief, and sadness.  

To be honest, the embrace feels good.  It feels good to feel.  I think it has given me an emotional outlet for the stress of the things that have been happening in the world over the last month.  I'm grateful for it.  It's ok to not be ok.  It's equally important to continue.  Emily Black concludes her book Sanctuary with a story about a dog who had finally broken free from a stake he was chained to:

> I could no longer see him but I imagined him: broken and trembling and terrified and damaged, he was still headed somewhere, resilient not because he 
> left his difficult life behind for something better, but because, like all of us, he carried the source and the history of his pain with him. The 
> instruments of his suffering were also part of his survival. This, then, is how we all must—and do—live.

As I end this blog post, I'm going to get ready for a 10 mile bike ride; the last time I did this ride was three weeks ago.  After I get that done, I think I'll start to get caught up on some chores that I've neglected over the last two weeks.  It's time to continue.
