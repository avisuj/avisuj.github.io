As a follow-up to my last post on Crypto, I thought I'd consolidate some of my learnings to a crawl walk run guide in Crypto.

## Crawl
- Buy some $USDC on [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) or [Gemini](https://www.gemini.com)
- Buy and setup a [HNT Miner](https://syncrob.it/) or a [MXC Miner](https://matchx.io/products/m2-pro-lpwan-crypto-miner?variant=40188735619267)
- Join the [Helium Discord](https://discord.gg/helium) or [MXC Discord](https://mxc.news/mxcdiscord)
- Sign up for [CoinTracker](https://www.cointracker.io) for Taxes
    - Configure the Coinbase or Gemini exchange
    - Configure an "Import from CSV" wallet for your HNT or MXC Miner.

## Walk

- Sign up for [Gate.io](https://www.gate.io)
    - Transfer your $USDC from Coinbase or Gemini to Gate.io
    - Sell your $USDC and buy $AVAX
    - Transfer your $AVAX to your metamask/hardware wallet
- Connect your metamask/hardware wallet to [Traderjoe.xyz](https://traderjoexyz.com/home#/farm)
    - Buy and stake $JOE
- Create a [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/) account
    - Redeem Coingecko rewards for [How to Defi](https://www.coingecko.com/account/rewards/how-to-defi-bundle?locale=en)
- Configure Cointracker with your Gate.io exchange and AVAX wallet

## Run
- Sign up for [TLDR Crypto](https://tldr.tech/crypto)

    - Join the Slime Shadies Discord

## Warning
- There are Fake Defi Apps in every App Store (iOS, PlayStore, Metamask store, etc.).  ***Unless you are restoring your wallet, never provide your [seed phrase](https://community.metamask.io/t/what-is-a-secret-recovery-phrase-and-how-to-keep-your-crypto-wallet-secure/) to anyone or anything.***
    - If you have given out your seed phrase, move your funds immediately.  A scammer will restore your wallet and drain any available funds.  $3.2 billion was stolen in 2021.  
    - If your funds have been stolen, do not pay a service that claims they will help you recover them.  They will also steal your money.
- When transferring tokens from Gate.io to Coinbase or Gemini, make sure to use the ETH/ERC20 chain.
    - Coinbase and Gemini only support the Ethereum block chain currently.
    - The naming convention for EVM compatible chains are the same.  This includes Ethereum, BSC, MATIC, TRX, AVAX, FTM, etc.
    - Gate.io will allow you to withdraw coin in a variety of different chains.
    - If you transfer coin to your Coinbase or Gemini wallet using a chain other than Ethereum, your funds will be lost.
- Crypto is a high risk investment; use a [portfolio re-balancing strategy](https://afterschoolfinance.com/portfolio-rebalancing-strategies) to manage your investment.
    - [Yield Chasing](https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-yield-farmers-chase-high-returns-but-risk-losing-it-all-11626514200) and [FOMO Investing](https://monetka.blog/articles/crypto-fud-fomo-holding/) are real and will make you lose your investment.
