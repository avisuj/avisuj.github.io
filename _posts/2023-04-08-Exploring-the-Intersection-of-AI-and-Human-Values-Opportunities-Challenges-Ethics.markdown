excerpt: "This blog post explores the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and human values, including the benefits and risks of AI, the impact of AI on human qualities and dignity, and the importance of ethical AI. It discusses the potential of AI to augment human capabilities, but also the need to ensure that AI is aligned with human interests and values and does not cause harm or injustice. Ultimately, it highlights the dynamic and evolving nature of human qualities and the role of technology in shaping them, and calls for a responsible and reflective approach to the design, development, and use of AI systems."

I'm starting to use ChatGPT to summarize documents, plan my summer vacation, and write blog posts.  It's been an amazing assistant that I'm going to put to the test as I try to do even more with the same finite time I have available.  It's given me an intermediary choice between outsourcing an activity and doing it myself; getting automated assistance.  

For example, this summer we are planning a vacation from Miami to Bar Harbor Maine.  I think I'll be an amazing experience taking us through ten cities on the east coast - through national parks, museums, cities and landmarks in thirty days.  Initially, Missy and I set target locations and decided on potential dates.  After, I used ChatGPT to generate suggestions about specific itinerary that we should do in each location.  In combination with packaged tours, we were able to get to an itinerary that is tailored to us.  Because we had control, I was able to leverage loyalty programs that we have with Enterprise, Marriott, and Amtrak to maximize our benefits.  Because I value that control, I've taken the role of a travel agent for the trip.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of machines to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as reasoning, learning, decision making, and creativity. AI has been advancing rapidly in recent years, thanks to the availability of large amounts of data, powerful computing resources, and innovative algorithms. AI has also been applied to various domains and industries, such as health care, education, entertainment, finance, security, and more.

AI has brought many benefits and opportunities to humanity, such as improving efficiency, productivity, quality, and innovation. However, AI also poses many challenges and risks, such as ethical dilemmas, social impacts, legal issues, and existential threats. How can we ensure that AI is used for good and not evil? How can we balance the benefits and risks of AI? How can we respect human values and dignity in the age of AI? 

I've recently read Moonwalking with Einstein by Joshua Foer.  In the book, Foer recounts how he became interested in memory training and over the course of a year became the US memory champion.  Memory training was once a critical part in education.  As we started relying on writing and later devices to help our memory, memory training became impractical.  Even so, it feels like there was something that was lost:
> Mere reading is not necessarily learning—a fact that I am personally confronted with every time I try to remember the contents of a book I’ve just put down. To really learn a text, one had to memorize it. As the early-eighteenth-century Dutch poet Jan Luyken put it, “One book, printed in the Heart’s own wax / Is worth a thousand in the stacks.”

If that's the case with memory, what happens when you augment the way you think with artificial intelligence?  If all people possess Descartes "good sense", the ability to distinguish truth from fiction, than do I retain my being as long as I am accountable?  

I think these questions are important because they touch upon the core of what makes us human. As humans, we have a unique capacity to think critically, creatively, and ethically. We have a unique ability to reflect on ourselves and our actions. We have a unique responsibility to act according to our moral values and principles. We have a unique dignity that deserves respect and protection. We have a unique solidarity that binds us together as a community.

However, these human qualities are not fixed or static. They are dynamic and evolving. They are influenced by our environment and our interactions with others. They are also influenced by our tools and technologies. As Marshall McLuhan famously said: "We shape our tools and thereafter our tools shape us." This means that the technologies we use can affect how we think, feel, and act. They can also affect how we perceive ourselves and others.

Ethical artificial intelligence is a topic that concerns how humans and machines interact with each other in a way that respects human values, rights, and dignity. It also involves the moral principles and guidelines that should inform the design, development, and deployment of AI systems, as well as the accountability and responsibility of those who create and use them. Some of the main ethical principles of AI are transparency, fairness, non-maleficence, beneficence, privacy, trust, sustainability, dignity, and solidarity . These principles aim to ensure that AI systems are aligned with human interests and values, and do not cause harm or injustice to individuals or society . Ethical AI is important because it can have significant impacts on various aspects of human life, such as health, education, work, security, and culture.

I think the potential of the unknown will drive further exploration.  While we are walking the path, we will learn how our creation affects us - if it leads us to harness more knowledge or instead reinforce our vices.  In truth, it will probably do both.
