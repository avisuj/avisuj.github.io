excerpt: "I explore the intriguing question of why people hold differing moral judgments. Drawing inspiration from Daniel Pink's observations, I delve into the diversity of moral values and the role of personal identity. Through the lens of the Moral Foundations theory and insights from Brene Brown, I examine how conscious cultivation of core values can strengthen identity, guide ethical decisions, and offer a resilient foundation in overcoming life's challenges."

In [Philosophy Club](https://www.facebook.com/groups/697782017619644/posts/1384069062324266/?__cft__[0]=AZVS3j0VgZ0lVby1067q1jloX9EhyPKaYwDtB8lfY0xsUg8zCaIbjRPlGo6PNy4DjSm15WEksvYWES_NnH6QBB7oyfAckkGlsOmMnj79fg0mebWhO7KkxMLgdmHx8TbiaLlf-cqJXkvo4ZUPizkQJae9&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R), Nikola recently asked "Why do people compete with each other instead of helping each other?"  This reminded me of a question posed by Daniel Pink in the Power of Regret, why do people make different moral judgments?  Pink provides several examples: "for example, is it wrong for children to talk back to their parents?  To call adults by their first name? Is it wrong for a woman to get an abortion, for a man to marry another man, or for people of any gender to wed multiple spouses?"

Many times when we're faced with these differences, we tend to absolutes - I am right and they are wrong.  Instead, what if the different opinions stem from different world views?  The Moral Foundations theory by Jonathan Haidt posits that belief on morality rests on five pillars:
- Harm/Care: We should prevent harm and promote care for others. 
- Fairness/Reciprocity: We should be treat people fairly and justly. 
- Ingroup/Loyalty: We should value and protect our own social groups. 
- Authority/Respect: We should value structures that maintain stability and social order.
- Purity/Sanctity: We should strive for sacredness, cleanliness, and maintaining a sense of moral purity.

These five moral foundations are not universally valued to the same extent across cultures and individuals. Different people and societies may emphasize some foundations more than others, leading to variations in moral values and political beliefs.  An individual's sense of identity can be shaped by the foundations they prioritize, and their interactions with others who share similar or differing moral foundations can further strengthen or challenge their identity.

Personal identity refers to the distinct set of characteristics, qualities, beliefs, values, interests, and experiences that define an individual as a unique person. It is the core sense of self that distinguishes one person from another.  
Identity is not static; it can evolve over time due to personal experiences, interactions with others, and changes in circumstances.  Over time, individuals may engage in introspection and exploration to better understand themselves. This ongoing process contributes to the development of personal identity.

In Dare to Lead, Brene Brown challenges people to define identity by core values: 
Our values should be so crystallized in our minds, so infallible, so precise and clear and unassailable, that they don’t feel like a choice—they are simply a definition of who we are in our lives. In those hard moments, we know that we are going to pick what’s right, right now, over what is easy. Because that is integrity—choosing courage over comfort; it’s choosing what’s right over what’s fun, fast, or easy; and it’s practicing your values, not just professing them.

My core values are [heart and integrity](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-core-values-integrity-heart-avi-sujeeth/).  I've built a reinforcing sense of identity around.  It helps me be true to myself.  I am:
	• A Catholic - Catholics are called to love God and love one another.  Catholics are encouraged to live with honesty and integrity in all aspects of their lives. 
	• A father and husband - I love my family and strive to live the Good Life with them.
	• A Technologist - I believe building technology can make the world better.

People often have agency over certain aspects of their identity, such as their personal beliefs, interests, and values. They can make choices about the ideologies they embrace, the hobbies they pursue, and the values they prioritize.   When making that choice, I think it's important to build a strong identity.  A strong identity and a weak identity refer to the level of clarity, confidence, and coherence an individual has in their sense of self and affiliations.  A strong identity guides individuals in making decisions that align with their values and aspirations.  People with a weak identity may compare themselves to others more often and feel envious of others.  

My identity helps me live my values and provides a foundation for growth.  I can always be better at living with heart and integrity.  Because these values are things I strive for verse fixed traits; feedback represents an opportunity to learn and enrich my life's journey.  In fact, I think this provides the foundation to overcome adversity like my recent layoff.

In summary, identity, values, and ethics are all intertwined.  When they are reinforcing, they can provide clarity and coherence that provides confidence that we will do what's right over what is easy.  A well-chosen identity can connect us with others through a shared sense of right and wrong.  Those relationships can provide the energy to go far; further than we could ever go by ourselves.
