excerpt: "2023 has been a challenging year - our family is going through a religious awakening, I got laid off, and Abby is a teenager.  I feel like I've risen to the opportunity and still feel intimidated about how much change still needs to happen.  I take a solace in the thought - if you improve one percent day, by the end of the year you are nearly 4x better than you started.  Here's to what 2024 brings."

# Overview
This year, I'm using this moment to take a hard look at the direction of my life to make sure it's the way I want to go.  Yesterday, at mass - Fr. Manickam gave a homily on the holy family.  He encouraged parisioner's to raise their family in a spirit of confessional as opposed to a boardroom.  A confessional approach involves open and honest communication among family members, where everyone is encouraged to share their thoughts and feelings. This approach can help build trust and foster a sense of unity among family members. However, it can also lead to conflicts if family members have different opinions or values.  The boardroom approach involves treating the family like a business, with clear roles and responsibilities for each member. This approach can help ensure that everyone is working towards the same goals and can help avoid conflicts. However, it can also lead to a lack of emotional connection among family members.

I want a family where we feel love and laughter is shared.  I want to know that family members are financially secure and take risks necessary to embrace opportunities.  I dream of a Christmas spent at church, celebrating our blessings, and helping others.    

Looking back, it's pretty clear I've run my family as a boardroom.  I need to pivot to accomplish my goals.  To that end I'm restructuring these posts to relfect on my priorities in the appropriate order: Faith, Family, Personal.  

# Notable Events

- Starting RCIA - Abby asked me why she should go to religious education if I wasn't even Catholic.  To fix that, I started Rite of Catholic Initiation for Adults.  I look forward to baptism and confirmation this Easter.
- Creating the [Sujeeth Foundation](https://www.sujeeth.org) - Five years ago, I felt lost.  I felt like I had stopped growing at work and wasn't sure about what was next.  Missy and I came up with an idea of a foundation to help students realize the benefits from education - like we had.  Last year, I took our charitable giving and jump started the foundation.  This year we're going to start our first partnership with the University of Missouri.
- [East Coast Vacation](https://www.instagram.com/p/CvXpqGephJw/) - We did a third set of vacations as a family - doing a trip from Miami to Bar Harbor Maine.  My favorite part of the vacation was fishing with the kids.  
- Microsoft Layoff - This year Microsoft eliminated the Customer Success Manager role; consolidating the role with other existing field roles.  Unfortunately, I hadn't prepared an exit and was caught in the RIF.  I ended up landing an Account Executive role at a Microsoft partner, Planet Technologies.
- Passing of Jayetathi - My dad's adopted mother passed away.  I wasn't close to her as language was a barrier.
- Mom diagnosed with cancer - My mom was diagnosed with breast cancer.  Fortunately, it was caught early and she is starting treatment at MD Anderson.

# Faith
- Prayer and Scripture - My prayer life is stronger than it has ever been.  I've tried to emulate some of the prayers I've seen in the Chosen including the Kiddush and Modeh Ani.  In fact, as a family, we are looking forward to celebrating the sabbath with a [guide from the Celebration Church](https://s3.amazonaws.com/downloads.celebration.org/2019/downloads/Shabbat+Guide+2019+_+final+Version.pdf).
- Communion and Sacraments - We attended Christmas service for the first time in several years.  In fact we attended Sunday service 34 times this year; nearly twice as often as we attended last year.  There's more work to be done to ensure our life is anchored in faith, yet I've already seen some significant benefits.  God centers our discussion over dinner.  Isaac sings songs during mass.  Abby has started to genuflect again.  I look forward to the day when our faith brings joy to the center of our family.
- Service and Community - I've started attending Men's club and Man Up.  In addition to the faith formation through RCIA, I've found community rewarding.  Faith is meant to be shared.  I offered to help with Loaves and Fishes; I look forward to incorporating that into my routine.

# Family
- Communication - A lot of our communication in the family is sarcastic.  Sometimes we fight.  We are good about setting and respecting boundaries.  We do talk through issues.  I want our communication to be more vulnerable and about our hopes and desires. 
- Encouragement - We show up for each other.  We also encourage each other to take risks.  I want us to be each others cheer leaders.  I want family to be a space where we find restoration.
- Religious Orientation - We have made a lot of progress here.  I look forward to the day that church feels more like a blessing than a chore.  
- Social Connectedness - Isaac started soccer this year.  Missy started working as a substitute teacher.  While I feel like Missy and I live lives of service, I feel like I need to do a better job of inviting the children into service.  A highlight for the year was when Abby volunteered with me and the Men's club raking the stations of the cross.
- Roles - In many ways our roles are well established.  I think I could do better at treating the children as full members of the family with age appropriate responsibilities.  Too often, I end up doing their work because it is easier.

# Personal
- Wellness - I'm really into the Calasthenics workouts I picked up over the summer.  While I gained five pounds this year, My body composition is back to 2019 levels.  In fact, as of December I have lost 8lbs of body fat.  If I can continue to lose another 10lbs of body fat, I will be leanest I've ever been.  The improved health also showed up with an improved HRV for the first time since I've been tracking.  I was able to run a 12 minute mile.  I'm working towards a 9 minute mile and some skills like the L-sit, crow pose, and Toes to bar.  
- Finances - In a large part thanks to restatement, our net worth increased by 27%.  The restatement stems from recognizing life insurance investments as well marking to market our home value.  Our investments only grew by 18% underperforming SPY.  We were able to pay off the mortgage this year with the severance from Microsoft.  This allowed us to shrink our monthly budget by roughly $1000/month which corresponds with the reduction in take home pay from Planet Technologies.  In addition, we're going to spread out our vacations more in order to save for them over a few years.  Overall we're in better shape than I thought we'd be in.
- Sustainability - Our electricity usage continued to reduce to 19,675WKH (6% improvement).  Our largest expenditures were the AC, HVAC fan, and the Car.  Our natural gas usage increased by 23%, mainly due to a dramatic jump in January and Febrauary.  This year we're going to experiment with using the fireplace more to help moderate our heating needs.

2023 has been a challenging year - presenting many significant changes.  I feel like I've risen to the opportunity and still feel intimidated about how much change still needs to happen.  I take a solace in the thought - if you improve one percent day, by the end of the year you are nearly 4x better than you started.  Here's to what 2024 brings.
