Dear Abby,

Watching you at the band banquet—beaming with pride and excitement—was a moment I won’t forget. You carried yourself with such grace and joy. I see the work you're putting in to become a leader, and I’m so proud of you for trying out. Even more, I’m proud of how you’re handling the disappointment of not making it this time. That kind of resilience is rare. Keep learning. Keep striving. You’re on the path. You will get there.

Your art and writing continue to blow me away. You’ve got real talent—don’t brush it off. I genuinely believe you could build something meaningful with it. But more than that, I think writing can help you process the messiness of life. It can bring clarity to confusion and help you connect deeply with others who need your voice.

I also really appreciate how seriously you're considering engineering. You’re a builder by nature—whether it’s ideas, music, or meaning. I can't wait to meet the version of you that has all these passions integrated. You’re not just choosing a major, you’re shaping a life.

It hurts me to see you in pain. I wish I could take it away, but I know some parts of growing up can’t be skipped. Adolescence is full of change—body, mind, heart. It’s normal to feel uncomfortable in your skin sometimes. But please hear me on this: you are a child of God. You are beautifully and wonderfully made. No insecurity or mistake can change that.

I’m asking you to read Mere Christianity not as a homework assignment, but as a gift. I hope it helps you remember that God doesn’t just love you in some vague, cosmic way—He loves you, specifically. He desires a relationship with you, in all your questions and doubts, your creativity and strength.

I love you. I always will. I’m here—no matter what.

With all my heart,
Dad
