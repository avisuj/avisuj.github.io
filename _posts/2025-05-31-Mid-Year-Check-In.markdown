excerpt: "This mid-year reflection is my way of climbing the tree—pausing to make sure I’m heading in the right direction, not just moving fast. With the help of ChatGPT, I’ve been able to evaluate my growth against the development plan I set in January, which centers on leading with integrity and living with alignment. I’m grateful to see real progress in my work, faith, and impact through the Sujeeth Foundation. But I also see where I need to go deeper: writing letters to my kids, being more emotionally present at home, committing to longer-form writing, and carving out time for a silent retreat. It’s hard work—but this year, for the first time in a while, I feel like my voice and my vocation are in sync."

In *The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People*, Stephen Covey tells the story of a group hacking their way through the jungle. One man climbs a tree, looks out, and yells, “Wrong jungle!” It’s a reminder that leadership isn’t just about moving fast—it’s about making sure you’re headed in the right direction.

That’s what mid-year reviews are for. They’re not about performance metrics or task lists. They’re about climbing the tree—pausing long enough to ask, *Is this still the right jungle?* *Am I living the life I set out to live?*

Thanks to ChatGPT, this process has become richer for me. I’ve been able to track my growth against the development plan I wrote in January, review my blog posts, and cross-check how I *feel* with the goals I set. That blend of story, data, and self-awareness? That’s the gold.

## My 2025 Development Plan: A Quick Recap

I opened the year with one central theme: **Lead Without Splitting, Grow Without Striving**. The plan spanned six areas:

1. **Spiritual** – silent retreat, examen, confession  
2. **Family** – letters to each child, weekly family examen  
3. **Foundation** – mentor formation, school shepherds  
4. **Professional** – 2 transformation-led deals, seller coaching  
5. **Writing** – 12 short posts, 3 essays on tech, faith, fatherhood  
6. **Health** – maintain readiness score >75, body fat <22%

I wasn’t aiming for hustle. I was aiming for integration.

## Mid-Year Check-In: What’s True So Far

- **Spiritually**, I’m anchored. I haven’t done the retreat yet, but grace has been close. The examen and weekly scripture have shaped how I lead and listen.  
- **Professionally**, I’ve found my lane. With Quisitive, I’m doing work that aligns with conviction. I’ve closed meaningful projects like the PVD311 system and Copilot pilot, both driven by executive trust and transformation—not just tech.  
- **Foundation-wise**, we’re thriving. Sujeeth Foundation is doing more than logistics. We’re mentoring with formation in mind. The audit gave that a 5/5, and it feels right.  
- **Writing has a heartbeat.** I’ve published over 8 short posts. The voice is there. The essays still need to emerge.  
- **Health is a mixed bag.** My readiness score is solid (76.75), but I’m not where I want to be in body composition.  
- **Family** needs focused re-engagement. I’m present, but not yet *attuned*. Marriage and bonding both scored 3/5 in the Good Life Audit—respectable, but a signal for deeper investment.

## What Needs Attention in H2

The audit and review surfaced four things I want to focus on more:

1. **Letters to my children** – I’ve delayed, but they matter. Each deserves words that bless and see them.
2. **Date nights and emotional presence** – I’m with my wife, but not always present. Love deepens in the margins.
3. **Writing essays** – Short posts share momentum. Long form builds meaning. It’s time to go deeper.
4. **Silent retreat** – I need that unhurried space to listen deeply and reset from the inside out.

## Why I’m Grateful

Because this year, I’ve found something rare: **my voice is matching my vocation**. I’m doing work that matters, for people I care about, in a way that aligns with my faith. That’s not small. That’s the result of prayer, clarity, and community.

I’m not done. There’s much to grow. But I’m no longer just hacking through the jungle. I climbed the tree. I looked around. And by God’s grace—I’m in the right one.
