excerpt: "As a born Hindu and practicing Catholic, my faith journey has been complex.  It's a core part of who I am.  Likewise, it's a core part of how I'm trying to lead my family.  As the pandemic becomes less dangerous, I'm looking forward to rekindling the relationship with the local faith community."

Throughout my childhood I struggled with fitting in.  As an Indian growing up the United States, I've always felt too Indian to be American and too American to be Indian.  That problem was particularly acute when I was growing up because I didn't really understand who I was and what I found to be important.

My parents for the most were un-religious.  While my mom grew up as a practicing Hindu, my dad grew up in a household that was mainly non-religious.  My dad's experiences set the tone for our nuclear family and I recall awkwardly going to temple once a year.  

When I expressed to my dad that I was struggling with my identity in adolescence, he decided that it would be best to take me out of public school and send me to private school. To be honest, I think there's a lot to be said about that: In her [Ted Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/yuko_munakata_the_science_behind_how_parents_affect_child_development, "The Science Behind How Parents Affect Child Development"), Yuko Munakata points at that childhood development is complex and reflects environmental factors like friends and culture.  My dad was trying to immerse me in a culture that he saw as accepting, challenging, and successful.

The school indeed had a rich a culture with focused objective on nurturing students to "be a man."  The culture was embodied through growth - academically, spiritually, and physically.  To facilitate that growth, the school provided experiences.  Religion class was mandated every year.  Monthly students attended an all school mass.  I even had the opportunity to participate in retreats with my fellow students.  By the time I had graduated from highschool, I had read the Bible cover to cover.  The spiritual environment helped me establish a north star even though I felt like I was misfit in the community.  It instilled in me the concept of objective truth that I could take with me and rely on regardless of situation and circumstance.  For me that guidance was critical part of learning to be comfortable with my own skin and my own values.  It provided a structure for me to think about loving God and loving other people; a way of exploring what the good life meant.

Likewise, the school reaffirmed in many ways that I was a misfit.  I was one of the few minority students.  As a non-Catholic, I was one of the only students who didn't approach the table to receive the Eucharist.  Through my education experience, I learned the importance of understanding detail and how that related to commitment.  In the context of faith, I learned how that agreement established norms and culture and how differences expressed in schism became important manifestations of belief:
- How important is suffering to the human experience?
- How do you reconcile grace with works?
- How important is community ritual?

I found that community helped me think through my responses to these prompts.  More importantly, I found that community was accepting of people regardless of cultural or economic background.  Truly in God, misfits can unite in an effort to make the world better.  As I approached graduation, I expressed to my mom that I wanted to convert.  I think the idea of change and societal expectations frightened her.  For example, recently she voiced concern that I wouldn't be able to participate in her funeral ceremony if I converted.  At the time, her response was to take me on a pilgrimage throughout South India to help me better understand my faith.

Through that pilgrimage, I learned that faith within my extended family was deep.  Many members of the family explored religion to understand inequality, suffering, charity, and acceptance.  I learned to appreciate other questions:
- How important is community?
- How important is acceptance?
- How important is sacrifice?
- How important is individual ritual?

In many ways it was beautiful experience.  Probably the most important thing I learned is that Faith could also unite people across distances as well as experiences.  I was able to relate to my family in ways that I hadn't before.  That exploration gave me a new way of understanding my family across the world and provided an on-ramp to learn about relationships that I had otherwise felt strained or broken.  From that experience, I'm still in contact with nearly three quarters of my first cousins.  In addition to my faith, grounding myself in family has provided a foundation from which I've been able to build.

## Leading Faith in My Family
Having experienced the grounding affects of faith, it's important to me that I can use it to center my family.  WHile the world gets smaller, I find my connections are spread further than they have been in the past.  As a family, we've moved twice.  My friends are spread across the world with concentrations in St. Louis, Minneapolis, San Francisco, Houston, Mumbai, Chennai, and Cochin.  I appreciate how easily my kids could feel like they are alone.  

Selecting a church has been an interesting process for me.  I don't think there's a faith that perfectly captures my relationship with God.  Likewise, I think there are many faiths that would offer unique opportunities to deepen that relationship.  With my wife, we ended choosing Catholic church because of the richness of community and balance between eastern and western religious thought.  

The faith journey during the pandemic hasn't been easy.  We've lost connection with our local church as we've avoided communion and faith formation to limit exposure.  In addition, the increasingly political stances taken by the Catholic church in the United States has compounded these feelings isolation.  In midst of this strife, I've also found embrace in shepherds who are ministering to a normally unchurched flock.  I find leaders like [Fr. James Martin](https://www.facebook.com/search/top?q=fr.%20james%20martin%2C%20sj) and [John Burke](https://www.gatewaychurch.com/staff/) inspiring.  I'm grateful for their outreach as it as has provided a sense of connection during these times.  

As we plan on returning to church, I'm looking forward to re-engaging with the local parish.  Ultimately, I think there's enough room for me in a church with over a billion members.  In addition, as a member of the community, I feel like it's important to be present in the effort to make church a respite for all who seek connection through faith.  Further, I think the rituals in the church reinforce things that I believe:

> We believe in one God,<br>
>    the Father, the Almighty,<br>
>    maker of heaven and earth,<br>
>    and of all that is, seen and unseen.<br>
><br>
> We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,<br>
>    the only Son of God,<br>
>    eternally begotten of the Father,<br>
>    God from God, Light from Light,<br>
>    true God from true God,<br>
>    begotten, not made, one in Being with the Father.<br>
>    Through him all things were made.<br>
>    For us men and for our salvation,<br>
>        he came down from heaven:<br>
> by the power of the Holy Spirit<br>
>    he was born of the Virgin Mary, and became man.<br>
><br> 
>For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;<br>
>    he suffered, died, and was buried.<br>
>    On the third day he rose again<br>
>        in fulfillment of the Scriptures;<br>
>    he ascended into heaven<br>
>        and is seated at the right hand of the Father.<br>
><br> 
>He will come again in glory to judge <br>
>        the living and the dead,<br>
>    and his kingdom will have no end.<br>
><br>
> We believe in the Holy Spirit,<br>
>    the Lord, the giver of life,<br>
>    who proceeds from the Father and the Son.<br>
>    With the Father and the Son he <br>
>        is worshipped and glorified.<br>
>    He has spoken through the Prophets.<br>
>    We believe in one holy catholic <br>
>       and apostolic Church.<br>
>    We acknowledge one baptism <br>
>        for the forgiveness of sins.<br>
>    We look for the resurrection of the dead,<br>
>        and the life of the world to come.<br>
><br>
> Amen.
