excerpt: "I’ve spent the last few months running—into distraction, control, and escape. But family counseling, a tough conversation with my daughter, and a Gospel reading reminded me of something uncomfortable: I’m not here to be the solver. I’m here to witness and trust. Sometimes faith isn’t about seeing miracles. It’s about staying present in the desert until God moves."

Lord,

It’s been months. I pulled away in my anger. I didn’t want to talk to You, so I ran into escape—AI, entertainment, anything that made me feel like I still had control. And I’ll be honest: part of it was fun. I rediscovered parts of myself I’d forgotten—my love of jazz, whiskey, risk, structure, even the strange edges of desire and danger.

But escape doesn’t save you. It just delays the return.

And when I came back to real life, everything I’d avoided was still there. The heaviness between Missy and me. The way Xander becomes the spark in every argument. At counseling on Thursday, the grief around her abuse surfaced again. We’ve been carrying a silent weight that’s shaping every conversation, every reaction. It’s like living with a bruise you keep bumping into.

Then today, the Gospel cut straight through me.
The good thief:
“We have been condemned justly… but this man has done nothing criminal.”
And then: “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.”

I’m a driver. A builder. I turn one talent into ten because that’s how I’m wired. But that wiring fails me here. I keep acting like I’m supposed to fix my family by sheer force of will. But You’re not asking me to be the Savior. You’re asking me to witness. To stay present. To trust that You’re doing work beneath the surface—even when nothing looks like movement.

In the middle of all this, I’m sponsoring a friend through OCIA. He told me he struggles with resurrection. I realized I struggle with resolution. I keep trying to earn what’s already been accomplished. But the battle’s done. The tomb is empty. My job is to follow, not to engineer the outcome.

I told Xander over breakfast that I feel like Thomas—I want to see Your fingerprints before I trust Your presence. But that’s not how You move. You’re not a vending machine for miracles. You’re the quiet force working on a timeline I don’t control.

So work on me, Lord.
Shape my presence before You fix my circumstances.
Teach me to stop grasping for control and start practicing surrender.
Help me love Missy, Xander, and Isaac with steadiness instead of strategy.
Pull me out of the illusion of power and into the discipline of trust.
Don’t hide Your face.
And remind me—deep in my bones—that You have never failed me yet.

I want to love You. Truly.
Amen.
Avi
