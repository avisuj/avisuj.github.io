Yesterday, Abby shared with me that her definition of success was based around wealth.  That hit my hard because I think I’m falling short on God’s call to be charitable.  While Missy and I give a lot in terms of money, time, and talent – we live a comfortable life.  God calls us to give until it begins to hurt.  
From the conversation, I began to reflect about how I define success.  To me, success means living a “meaningful life”.  I think there are many paths to find meaning in life.  

#Faith
For me the most obvious path is the one routed in faith.  Saints have shown us how we can discern God’s will to use our talents:
- in alleviating poverty (Saint Francis of Assisi, Saint Vincent de Paul, Saint Mother Teresa), 
- advancing science and education (Saint Albert the Great, Saint Thomas Aquinas, Saint Ignatius of Loyola), 
- comforting sinners (Saint Mary Magdalene, Saint Agustine de Hippo, Saint John Vianney), 
- supporting those who sacrifice (Saint Joseph, Saint Maximilian Kolbe).  

The church provides a framework to help discern good – we will be able to tell good based on the fruit of the tree.  If the outcomes of an action are good, the action is likely to be good.  Further, actions can be evaluated based on the action itself, the intent and the circumstance.  
By saying yes to God’s will we are likely journey towards a meaningful life. 

#Family
A Harvard Study on Happiness underscores the significance of quality relationships in fostering happiness and well-being over the lifespan. Close, supportive relationships—with family, friends, and community—are consistently linked to greater happiness, health, and longevity.  Contrary to popular belief, it's the quality, not the quantity, of relationships that matters most. Meaningful connections characterized by trust, empathy, and intimacy have a profound impact on happiness and overall life satisfaction.  Ultimately, the Harvard study emphasizes the transformative power of meaningful connections—with oneself, with others, and with the world around us. Investing in relationships, nurturing emotional health, pursuing personal growth, and living authentically are the cornerstones of a fulfilling and meaningful life.

#Economic
Many business leaders have contributed to the world.  They have helped harness creativity to generate value that improves the quality of life in aggregate.  Corporations have:
- resulted in 100x increase in food production since the industrial revolution
- resulted in 10x increase in travel
- resulted in 2x increase in life span
- resulted in 8x reduction in poverty

The good that leaders have contributed is obviously material.  An advantage of the economic system is that the accumulation of wealth can be a proxy of impact.  Generally, people accumulate more wealth when they can provide a narrow transactional benefit to a large group of people.

In addition to corporations, service organizations have helped deliver those results by reallocating resources in the economic system from donors to individuals that have need.  Like corporations the impact of these organizations can be measured through donations and people served.

#Political
Political leaders have a profound impact on society, shaping its values, institutions, and collective identity. Leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr., George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Franklin D. Roosevelt have left an indelible mark on history, each impacting society in profound ways. Through their leadership, they navigated tumultuous times, championed causes that resonated with the public, and inspired transformative change.  Political leaders have the power to shape society through their actions and influence. By forging meaningful connections with people, articulating a compelling vision for the future, and mobilizing collective action, leaders can inspire positive change and leave a lasting impact on society.

In summary, for me success is based on living a meaningful life – a life that positively impacts those we are connected with.  There are many paths to that success and the specific path is unique to the individual based on the charisms that God has provided.
