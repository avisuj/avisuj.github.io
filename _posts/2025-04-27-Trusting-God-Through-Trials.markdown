**Dear Lord,**

I am grateful for your gifts.

## Palm Sunday: The Rag Man

On Palm Sunday, I participated in an OCIA retreat where the story of the **Rag Man** was read.

The Ragman walks through a broken city, offering to trade clean rags for old, dirty, and bloodied ones. But with every exchange, he doesn't just take the rags—he takes on the people's wounds and sorrows. He grows weaker and weaker until he dies, carrying it all. And then, on the third day, he rises—restored and glorified.

Lord, the story struck me deeply. Before your sacrifice, sin could only be shifted from one place to another. But you—the unblemished Lamb—took it all on yourself, once and for all. You chose to bear the full weight of brokenness, so we could be free.

## Good Friday: A Deeper Realization

During the **Stations of the Cross** on Good Friday, I had another moment of clarity:  
You knew the suffering ahead. You chose it freely. Not for yourself, but for love—for all of us.

Lord, I am grateful for your vision and persistence. You never abandoned your purpose, even when the cost was everything.

## Family Struggles and Grace

Things in our family are improving, Lord, and I know it’s by your hand. But I have been negligent in conversation with you. Forgive me. Thank you for reminders like the one from Andrea Jackson with the Evangelical Catholic—that my first task is always to remember you and share your Good News.

Even in good times, trials still come.

On **Holy Thursday**, Abby shared some of her struggles with church: feeling like she can be with you anywhere, frustration with structure, and a sense that deeper conversations are missing. She wants more—more dialogue, more authenticity.

Missy and I have had disagreements about faith too. At times, Abby's objections sounded familiar—echoes of old wounds and loneliness Missy and I shared. Fearing that our past was blocking our future, Lord, I was angry. I felt alone in trying to raise our children in faith.

## Good Friday: A Test of Love

On **Good Friday**, tension boiled over as we prepared for the service. Missy corrected me sharply about the *"Stations of the Cross service,"* and old hurts surfaced. I see now that she was triggered by years of feeling isolated at church.  She needed to be validated.

At the time, though, I didn’t let it drop—I wanted so badly for our children to understand the invitation I was extending. Missy, overwhelmed, dropped me off at church and went home in tears. But by your grace, she spoke to the kids about faith and family—and they chose to come.

Lord, it had been nearly four months since Abby last came to Mass. You brought new life out of what felt like a broken moment.

## Walking Home: Finding Love Again

After the service, my heart was still unsettled. I started walking home, wrestling with my anger and sadness.

But as I walked, I talked with you, Lord. I thought about how you challenge others, always starting from love. By the time Missy found me halfway home, the only thing left in my heart—the only thing worth saying—was:  
**"I love you all."**

You were with me, Lord. You are always with us.

## Trusting the Journey Ahead

Since Easter, we’ve been healing. It’s not perfect, but it’s real. There are big decisions ahead—work, home, our future—but I trust you. I know my discernment isn’t perfect, but you are.

Lord, I will pause. I will listen. I will keep moving forward, trusting that you are shaping our family through every trial and every triumph.
