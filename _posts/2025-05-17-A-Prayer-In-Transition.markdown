excerpt: "A heartfelt prayer reflecting on life's transitions, reminding us that our role isn't to fix everything, but to live intentionally and faithfully through uncertainty."

I’ve been sitting with a lot lately—new job, new routines, big decisions. In the quiet moments, I find myself praying not with polished words but with genuine presence.

Here’s what came out recently. I'm sharing this not because I have answers but because I'm learning to live the questions.

**Lord,**

Thank you.

Truly, thank you. Amid transitions, emotional landmines, and dashed expectations, we’re still okay. You've been faithful in quiet ways. I'm learning to recognize those moments as enough.

I moved from Planet to Quisitive. It wasn't dramatic—just a difference in perspective on compensation. No bad blood, simply a shift. Planet has great people, and I'm grateful for all I learned there. At Quisitive, I'm energized by the renewed focus on healthcare. It feels right to work where outcomes matter—not just financially, but in people's lives.

We put in an offer on a house, a meaningful next step. But Missy later admitted she didn’t like it and didn’t feel safe expressing her feelings openly.

That stopped me. Fear has no place in our home. Her voice matters deeply, and I need her to believe that. You're teaching me that real love isn't about getting our way but creating a refuge.

There are wounds in our past that still ripple. Experiences we've moved past but haven't fully healed from. Sometimes fear resurfaces, carrying echoes of those difficult seasons. But you see us. You're still writing our redemption story.

I lift Abby up to you. She's grappling with deep questions about identity and expression, seeking clarity in a world full of expectations. Remind her, Lord, that she is yours—not just a work in progress, but already beloved, already named, already seen.

And remind me that it isn't my job to control her journey. My role isn't to fix everything but to remain close—close to her, to Missy, and especially to you.

Gilbert reminded me recently: my job isn't to fix it all but to bring it all to you. That's the shape of faith I'm still discovering—to father from presence, not pressure.

So I praise you for the goodness already present: Abby considering joining the church choir, me finding consistency in workouts again, and the joy of returning to Saint Vincent DePaul visits. Even amid missed Sundays and imperfect routines, your grace remains steady.

Work is moving, too. The Foundation feels renewed, breathing deeper vision. I sense something meaningful lies ahead, but I don't want to rush it faster than you're preparing me to carry it.

Keep me grounded. Keep me authentic. Keep me from confusing scale with sanctification.

Thank you for your patience, Lord. I desire to walk with you—more slowly, more quietly, more like a son.

*Amen.*
