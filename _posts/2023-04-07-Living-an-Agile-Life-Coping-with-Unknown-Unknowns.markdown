excerpt: "This blog post explores the concept of unknown unknowns and how they can impact our lives. It discusses the agile methodology as a way of coping with uncertainties and achieving personal goals. By breaking down goals into smaller tasks, embracing change, collaborating, and reflecting, we can better adapt to unknowns and live our best lives."

On the precipice of the Iraq Invasion, Donald Rumsfeld, the former US Secretary of Defense, said that there are three types of things in the world:
- Known knowns: These are things that we know that we know. For example, we know that the Earth is round and that water is wet.
- Known unknowns: These are things that we know that we don't know. For example, we don't know when the next earthquake will happen or who will win the next election.
- Unknown unknowns: These are things that we don't know that we don't know. These are the most unpredictable and surprising things that can happen. For example, we didn't know that a pandemic would hit the world in 2020 or that a new variant of the virus would emerge.

Unknown unknowns are future outcomes, events, circumstances, or consequences that we cannot predict. We cannot plan for them either. We don’t even know when and where to search for them. They pose a potentially greater risk simply because they cannot be anticipated based on past experience or investigation.

As I look into the future, it feels like I'm surrounded with unknown unknowns:
- Will the world order hold
- Will there be nuclear war
- Will artificial intelligence disrupt society

It's ok not to know the future.  In software development, the agile process was created to handle the unknown unknowns. Agile is a method of software development that was created to handle complex and uncertain projects. It's based on four principles:
- Deliver value early and often: Instead of waiting for a perfect product or solution, agile teams deliver small, testable, and valuable features or ideas in short cycles called sprints. This way, they can get feedback from customers or users and improve their product or solution quickly and continuously.
- Embrace change: Instead of resisting or fearing change, agile teams welcome it as an opportunity to learn and grow. They are flexible and responsive to changing requirements, market conditions, customer needs, and feedback. They also experiment with new ideas and technologies to find better ways of doing things.
- Collaborate: Instead of working in silos or hierarchies, agile teams work together as self-organizing and cross-functional units. They communicate openly and frequently with each other and with their stakeholders. They also share their knowledge, skills, and resources to achieve their common goals.
- Reflect and improve: Instead of repeating the same mistakes or sticking to the same habits, agile teams reflect on their performance and processes regularly. They identify what works well and what needs improvement. They also take action to implement changes and measure their impact.

This approach lets you adjust to changing environment by taking moments to recalibrate the plan from things you've learned.  Those micro-adjustments can make a world of difference in achieving a goal.

I believe that agile is not only a way of developing software but also a way of living life. It can help us cope with unknown unknowns by making us more adaptable, creative, and resilient.  That's why I have adopted agile as my personal philosophy and practice. I have set some goals for myself:
- I want to get into better shape
- I want to retire in Hawaii
- I want to see my kids be successful
- I want to make difference in the world through my work
- I want to start a scholarship to inspire others to live their best lives

I don't have to tackle all the things at once, but I can set goals like how much I need to have saved to retire to Hawaii or start the scholarship fund.  And I can look for opportunities to start things earlier.  For example, I'm investigating what it would take to start a 501-3C and if the software grants Microsoft makes to charitable organizations would allow me to start awarding a $5K annual scholarship right now.

By living my life as close to the present as I can, I get to savor simple pleasures, focus on today's actions, and embrace opportunities as they appear.  Reflecting on how I've done monthly, I can ensure that I am connecting what I'm doing with my long term goals.  In addition, I try to periodically look up to determine if I'm still happy with where I think I'm going.  When the world flips on its head, I hope this approach will allow me to adapt to the changes.
