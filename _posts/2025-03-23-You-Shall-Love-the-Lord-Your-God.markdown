excerpt: "I reflect on a lesson about prioritization, realizing that when I place God at the center of my life, everything else becomes clearer. A conversation with Missy reveals my struggles with communication, identity triggers, and the need to assume positive intent instead of assigning blame. Though I fear balancing family, work, and faith, I trust in God’s guidance to help me focus on love, truth, and His will."

## You Shall Love the Lord Your God

> "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind."

Lord, thank You for the Sabbath. Thank You for the reminder of Your love, my worthiness, and the foundation of our relationship. You are the solid ground on which I can build everything—including my apostolate.

### The Lesson of the Rocks

Today in Catechism, Dawn shared a story that struck me:

> A college professor conducted an exercise with students sitting in small groups. On their tables were a bucket, large rocks, pebbles, sand, and a pitcher of water.
> 
> The professor instructed them to place the rocks in the bucket. **"Is it full?"** he asked.
> 
> **"Absolutely,"** they replied.
> 
> Then he told them to add the pebbles. They fit. Then the sand. Then the water. Each time, the students thought the bucket was full—until they saw it could hold more.
> 
> Finally, the professor asked, **“What’s the lesson here?”**
> 
> Some students said it was about always being able to add more; others thought it was about pushing limits. But the professor explained: **The order matters.** Had they started with the water, the rocks wouldn’t have fit.

## Trusting in God’s Order

Lord, I know You are the rock in my life. The past few years have proven that when I drift from You, I show up worse in every other area. Without You, I lose my sense of purpose, and that makes it harder for me to express what I feel or what I am doing.

Yesterday, I was talking with Missy about the progress we had seen with Abby. As we work toward healthier communication, I found myself anxious about tough topics—her grades, her struggles, her identity. I shared my concerns with Missy, and she told me to focus on today and not micromanage.

**God, I got angry.**

I remembered what I learned in *Thanks for the Feedback*:

> ### Three Types of Feedback:
> 1. **Appreciation** – Acknowledgment and validation: "I see you, and I appreciate what you do."
> 2. **Coaching** – Guidance and advice: "Here’s how you can grow."
> 3. **Evaluation** – Ranking or rating against a standard: "This is where you stand."

I told Missy I wasn’t looking for **evaluation**—I needed **coaching** from a partner. Instead, I felt judged by her feedback.  

As I explained what I needed, She was hurt. She felt like I had been keeping things from her. And she was right—I had not done a great job of communicating in the past. Rather than open up, I had encouraged my family to engage with my thoughts through books, classes, or external resources. But I hadn't found the words to share my heart.

## Speaking in Love and Truth

Lord, as You take the center place in my life, You give me new words to express what is inside me. You remind me that I must be a better support for my family as we all grow and change. Thank You for the gifts of Your Spirit—these moments remind me that You are with me.

I am still anxious about the hard conversations ahead. But Missy’s words reminded me: **We are not there yet.** Right now, I need to focus on speaking in love and truth. I need to stay engaged, learning to communicate more fully with my family.

During our conversation, Missy told me she felt like I was asking her to change. I assured her that I love her exactly as she is. I wasn’t asking her to change—I was asking for space to express what I needed.

This conversation was difficult because it hit an **identity trigger**.

Missy and I both hold *Family* as a deep, core value. We want our children to be happy and thriving. When we see challenges, we assume we must have done something wrong.

Today’s Gospel spoke directly to my heart:

> *"Do you think that because these Galileans suffered in this way, they were greater sinners than all other Galileans? By no means!"*

Jesus reminds us that **we don’t need to assign blame** for suffering. Instead, we should seek God’s kingdom for comfort.

In our last counseling session, Sara encouraged us to **assume positive intent**. That lesson resonates now. As we move forward, we need to shed the shame we feel about where we are. We need to accept that we are here *despite* the fact that we genuinely tried and genuinely loved.

## Trusting in God's Plan

If I’m honest, God, I am afraid.

As I look ahead—to family counseling, work, the foundation—I worry. I don’t want to fall into old patterns, trying to balance everything. I fear I won’t be able to fit everything in my bucket.

But I trust You, Lord.

I trust that the Holy Spirit will remind me to **put the rocks in first**. I see it even in the small things—like the inspiration to write to You more frequently.

Watch over me, Lord, because I don’t always trust myself.

I am grateful for all my gifts, but most of all, I am grateful for Your presence in my life.

Above all, may **Your will be done.**

**Amen.**
