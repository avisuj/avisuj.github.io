excerpt: "When my daughter said, 'I think God should fit me,' I realized how easy it is to replace conviction with comfort. But love, real love, doesn’t demand agreement—it demands presence."

Dear Lord,

I've been reflecting on the spectrum of agreement we’re pressured to slide down every day:

**Tolerance → Accommodation → Acceptance → Support**

Culture equates love with affirmation, and disagreement with harm. But that’s not your way, Lord. Your love speaks truth and draws near—without needing to condone or condemn.

Here’s how I’m starting to make sense of it:

| **Stage**         | **Secular Meaning**                                                  | **Christian Reframe**                                                            | **Moral Risk**                          |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Tolerance**     | “I won’t stop you.”                                                  | I allow your freedom, even if I believe it’s misguided.                         | Indifference or passive disengagement  |
| **Accommodation** | “I’ll make room for you.”                                            | I adjust my behavior to preserve relationship, not compromise belief.           | Peacekeeping without truth              |
| **Acceptance**    | “I affirm your right to define truth for yourself.”                 | The tipping point—can drift into affirming error in the name of empathy.        | Relativism; loss of moral clarity      |
| **Support**       | “I will advocate for your truth.”                                   | When empathy becomes enablement.                                                | Complicity in confusion                |

You’ve given me a sacred responsibility:  
**To help my children know you—not just feel good about themselves.**

But Alexander believes you should conform to her understanding.  
And I get it. At times, I’ve wanted the same: a God who bends, not leads.

But that’s not the Gospel.  
That’s not the Cross.

Your love **confronts** sin by **forgiving** it.  
Your truth **exposes** confusion by **calling** us home.  
Your mercy **does not depend** on agreement—but it also **does not excuse** rebellion.

I’ve been thinking about Fr. Mike Schmitz and his brother.

> _“I love you. And I disagree with you.”_  
> That’s not cruelty. That’s clarity anchored in care.

The world screams that disagreement is violence.  
That not affirming someone’s self-conception is harmful.  
But when we equate truth with trauma, we lose the ability to love like you do.

Love that confronts is still love.  
Love that draws near without changing the standard is still love.

Last week at confession, I heard your whisper:

> _“You are my son. I love you. I trust you to do your best.”_

You didn’t demand perfection. You asked for surrender.  
You reminded me that obedience isn’t a performance—it’s presence.  
That leadership isn’t about fixing—it’s about following.

So I’m trying to lead in the small things.

**Trusting Fr. Mike’s example, I bought the kids _The Great Adventure Bible_.**  
I’ve asked them to read at least 15 minutes a day.  
We talk about it over dinner—sometimes awkwardly, sometimes deeply.  
But every conversation feels like a foothold in sacred ground.

It’s not about mastering theology.  
It’s about inviting them to meet you in the story—  
To see you not as someone they define, but someone they can follow.

Through Samuel. Through Fr. Manickam. Through your Spirit—  
You’ve been calling me back to the narrow path:

**Lead with conviction. Love with compassion. Speak without fear. Walk without striving.**

Help me love Alexander with clarity and patience.  
Not to win an argument. Not to rescue.  
But to reflect your heart.

Help me hold the tension like you do—  
Truth without fear. Grace without compromise.

I believe Psalm 23.  
Even the valley is part of the pasture.

**You know what you’re doing. I will follow you.**

**Amen.**
