As I lit our gas fireplace last night, the flames seemed to dance.  But just as quickly as they came alive, they would snuff out as the fuel exhausted.  Dead.  I think this impermanence lends to the flames beauty.  Demands attention.

A friend of the family passed away last night.  He left behind his wife, two daughters (20 and 12) and a son (9).  His middle child and Abby are friends.  Dead.  Sometimes life isn't fair.  

Thankfully in my last episode of depression, I went deep on grief:
- I read [It's OK that You're NOT OK](https://www.amazon.com/Its-That-Youre-Not-Understand-ebook/dp/B073XXYKLP/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=it%27s+ok+that+you%27re+not+ok&qid=1669070005&s=digital-text&sprefix=it%27s+ok+%2Cdigital-text%2C204&sr=1-1)

I learned that Grief is a natural reaction to Love that was taken away.  Grief cannot be fixed and it has no timeline.  Most people react to grief by trying to make it better.  You can never bring back my friends husband.  Sometimes people try to compare grief.  There's no award for sadness.  In fact, the best way to address grief is to witness it.

Sadness is interesting.  
> "Sadness triggers compassion.  It brings people together. . . The word compassion literally means 'to suffer  
> together' . . . The sadness from which compassion springs is a pro-social emotion, an agent of connection and
> love; it's what the musician Nick Cave calls 'the universal unifying force.'  Sorrow and tears are one of the
> strongest bonding mechanisms we have"  (Bittersweet, Susan Cain).
		
In the midst of loss how do you comfort one another?  On Sunday we went to church.  Missy was mad at me because I was forcing the motions and not showing "empathy".  In the quiet of the motions, bonding started to happen.  Prior to the service, Missy and Abby were able to quiet away a conversation on loss.  After the service, we were able to seek out prayer with a prayer leader which offered the palliative healing of confession.  Acknowledging our pain. Asking for help. Focus on what we wanted.  

In prayer I asked for the discernment to witness pain and be supportive.  To help without trying to fix the un-fixable.  To let our love be felt.  At the end of the prayer, Missy was a little misty eyed.  We also had greater appreciation of the task ahead of us.

After church, we ran Missy's parents and Isaac to the house.  Abby, Missy, and myself made the trek to our friend.  There we sat, we snacked, and we talked.  Sometimes we remembered.  Sometimes we cried.  We talked about help.  We talked about space.  We hugged.

It's the beginning of this process; but I think we were able to achieve our goal.  Now as life happens, I pray for grace that we remember what is important and keep that in the center of our life and outreach.
