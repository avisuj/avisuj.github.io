The past quarter has been a period of incredible growth and reflection for me. As I prepare to embark on a new chapter of my spiritual journey by becoming a neophyte in the Catholic Church, I've found profound meaning in centering my family in faith. Together, we've been reading a chapter from the Bible during dinner, leading to moments of deep connection and the uncovering of unintentional hurts that we've been able to address.

As Romans 5:8 reminds us, God's love for us is not contingent upon our goodness; rather, it is His love that empowers us to be good. This realization has been transformative, encouraging me to embrace truth and seek reconciliation in both my personal and familial relationships.

While rewarding, the quarter has also been busy.  I woke up yesterday and I couldn't articulate my goals for the year.  As such I thought I'd revisit.

At Microsoft, we used to do quarterly connects that invited employees to reflect on the past and prognosticate on the future.  Across personal accomplishment and the accomplishment of others a connect asked:
- What was accomplished
- What was learned 
- What will be done 
- How will you grow

I'm going to borrow format with some adjustments. In this post, I will reflect across faith, family, and personal accomplishments:
- What was accomplished
- How did I fail
- What I'm afraid of
- What are my goals for the next period

## Accomplishments:
- This Easter I'm going to be baptized and confirmed in the Catholic.  This is a significant step in my spiritual that I'm living through increased involvement in ministries like man-up and men's club.  In addition, I'm in the process of working through Bible studies from Logos and Augustine Institute.
- As a family, we're reading a chapter in the Bible with dinner.  We're also celebrating the Sabbath using a guide from Celebration church.  It's been rewarding to incorporate faith into our meals.  It's a reminder of our foundation.
- Missy and I are walking the faith journey together.  The journey is helping me appreciate Missy more.  We have started a weekly date night. 
- At work, I'm finding my footing at Planet Technologies.  In fact I had a promising day.  The goals set for me for the year is within reach. 
- At the Sujeeth Foundation, I'm working through my first work out loud circle with 25 volunteers and 150 students.  Every circle is meeting with a mentor and is getting incremental progress.
- I've been prescribed Fenofibrate to help moderate my cholesterol.  While my levels are elevated, they are materially lower than they were last year.  In addition, my body composition has returned to pre-covid and I continue to be increasing muscle mass and dropping body fat.  For the first time, I recently found that I was able to stand from sitting in the floor without using my hands.  I'm looking forward to being able to do more with my body.

My favorite memory from last period was a family dinner where Abby had a friend over.  We read the Bible and there was laughter.  It was peace.

## Failures:
- I had an opportunity to participate with Mobile Loaves and Fishes but was unable to make it work twice.  The schedule, right in the middle of school pickup, is a real challenge for a single car household.
- Regardless of intention, I haven't reached out to Dawn to plan out becoming a liturgical minister. 
- I haven't honored Missy as much as I should.  I haven't celebrated her jobs and her successes.  I don't tell her she's beautiful enough.  I don't show enough gratitude for our partnership.
- I have broken my commitment to get a new Microsoft certification every month. 
- I haven't been able to clearly identify the impact of the Sujeeth Foundation on students. 

## Fears:
- As I finish with Mystagogia and find myself in the world as a neophyte, I worry that I will lose focus on God.
- I worry as life gets busy, I get shorter with people and will try to take shortcuts on things that matter. 
- I worry that I'm not the father my children need and will fall short in showing compassion and guidance.
- I worry that I will not say yes to the right things and find myself marching through the wrong forest.
- I will worry that I will not have enough time to accomplish my goals. 

Matthew 6:27, 33 reminds me, "And who of you by being worried can add a single hour to his life? But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you." Therefore, I will leave these worries to God and follow his guidance to stay in my zone of genius.

## Goals and Action Plan:
- I commit to keeping God in the center of my life. In order to do that, I will double down on my efforts at daily prayer.
- I will look to join the eucharistic ministry and Saint Vincent De Paul with the time I get back from RCIA ending.
- I will take Isaac to soccer on Thursdays and Saturdays.  I will look to gain time by taking advantage of my home gym. 
- I will take Missy on a date weekly.
- I will figure out how to delegate work to meet my business commitments while keeping work from absorbing my life. 
- I will carve out learning days in my work week so that I can continually improve.
- I will work on the Sujeeth Foundation: evaluating the foundational principals contribution to outcomes, pages for schools and volunteers, and increasing the functionality in the portal.

As I reflect on my goals, my zone of genius needs to stay top of mind.  My zone of genius lies in building trusting relationships, continually learning through incremental experiments, and serving others to drive meaningful change.   By saying yes at things that provide energy, I am confident that I will be able to multiply using the gifts entrusted to me.
