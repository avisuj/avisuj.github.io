excerpt: "I tell Isaac how much I love him and how proud I was of his effort and pride as a defensive lineman this soccer season. I affirm his hustle and explain that doing the hard things others won’t is key to success in life. I encourage him not to rush growing up and share how meaningful it is to attend church together. I look forward to our time in religious education this fall. I close by urging him to build his life on the solid foundation of Christ’s teachings—like the wise man in the Sermon on the Mount—so that no matter what storms come, he’ll be able to stand strong."

Dear Isaac,

I love you. You are so much fun to be around, and I was really proud to watch you play soccer this year. I saw the pride you took in being a defensive lineman, and I loved the hustle you brought to the field. Hustle matters in life—success often comes down to doing the hard things other people won’t do.

I know you’re eager to grow up fast—but take your time. The journey matters just as much as the destination. I’m really glad you’ve been coming to church with me. I’m looking forward to doing religious education together this fall—it’s going to be something special we share.

Jesus tells us in the Sermon on the Mount that the wise man builds his house on rock—not sand. That rock is His teaching. When we follow what Jesus says—loving our enemies, telling the truth, giving generously, praying quietly, seeking God first—we’re not just being “good.” We’re building something that lasts. Life will have storms. But if your heart is rooted in Jesus’ words, you’ll be able to stand firm, no matter what.

So build your life on that kind of foundation. Not just with rules, but with the love and strength that comes from knowing God is with you and for you. I’ll be right here beside you as you grow into that.

Love,
Dad
