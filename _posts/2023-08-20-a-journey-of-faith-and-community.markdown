excerpt: "In my journey towards the Rite of Acceptance with the Catholic Church, I reflect on how taking up the cross of Christ and embracing His teachings has shaped my life. Moments like a transformative retreat experience and a surprising encounter with Pope John Paul II highlighted the power of God's love and the unity of the Catholic community. As I delve deeper into my faith, I grapple with the call to carry the cross, embrace communal teachings, and discern divine inspiration, finding solace and strength in the enduring embrace of faith."

As I stand at the threshold of the Rite of Acceptance with the Catholic Church, I find myself reflecting on the profound questions that have been posed to me:
- How do you see yourself taking up the cross of Christ in your Life?
- How has the Word of God come alive for you as you have traveled on your faith journey?

Having attended a Marianist high school and Jesuit college, I grew up around the Church.  In high school I struggled mightily with depression.  While my history means I'm predisposed to depression, I also struggled being an immigrant and defining my identity.  I was an [other](https://blog.avisuj.com/heart/integrity/legacy/Other/) and my otherness fueled the depression. 

One of the first times I felt God's love was in Chaminade's senior retreat, Kairos: The Kairos Retreat experience is a special time to reflect on who you are and who you want to be.  During the retreat, we explored what it means to be loved by God and how God's love reflected in our community.  A letter from my Dad was particularly touching - it acknowledged the strife I was feeling and was steadfast in support.  I realized that I could build my life on the bedrock of God's love.   

One of the first times I felt community was when I joined St. Louis University youth group to visit with Pope John Paul II.  The experience was amazing and not what I was expecting.  Students from across the greater Saint Louis area gathered to hear the Pope in a hockey arena.  It was packed.  The sound track could have streamed from K-Love.  The joy was palpable - there was no doubt that the Holy Spirit was among us.  

In light of my history and experiences, I contemplate the path of taking up the cross of Christ. It beckons me to deepen my relationship with Him and to embrace my challenges as pathways to growth. The Rite of Catholic Initiation for Adults has shown me that the Word, Worship, and Witness are intended to be communal.  The heart of the church's teaching is that relationship, captured in the trinity, extends to all of us.  In exploring with others, I am learning things about the church's teachings.  One enlightening conversation revolved around our individual draws to the Church. I shared my belief, captured in [Communion](https://blog.avisuj.com/faith/parenting/Communion/), that the church makes me a better person, a better father, and a better husband.  I pointed out that those teachings have had the benefit of millennia of learnings and tradition.  My friend interjected - don't forgot about divine inspiration.  

As I embark on this journey, I am confronted with my personal challenge of discerning divine inspiration and staying faithful. What do I seek from God's Church? The answer resonates clearly: FAITH. It's through faith that I am empowered to navigate the complexities of life, carrying with me the lessons of the cross, the teachings of the Church, and the everlasting presence of divine inspiration.
