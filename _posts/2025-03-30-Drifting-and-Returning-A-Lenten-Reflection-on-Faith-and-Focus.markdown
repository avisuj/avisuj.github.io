excerpt: "This week reminded me how easily I drift from God without daily commitment. The Prodigal Son’s return and his father’s compassion struck a chord, especially as Missy and I navigate parenting’s challenges. While Abby is making strides, I found myself struggling—disappointment over Microsoft’s rejection led me into distraction and indulgence, wasting time on social media instead of being present.

Recognizing the cycle of doubt, temptation, and sin, I’m giving up Facebook for Lent and refocusing on God’s plan. I need His strength to guide my family, especially as Isaac voices doubts and Abby challenges our parenting. My value isn’t in work but in helping my family find Him."

Dear Lord,

Sunday couldn't come soon enough. As the week goes on, I find myself drifting further from Your centering force. I need to recommit to daily readings, much like tending to a wound that requires constant care. Without that commitment, I lose sight of what truly matters.

Today in OCIA, we reflected on the parable of the Prodigal Son. The son demanded his inheritance early, squandered it on indulgence, and soon found himself destitute. Starving, he took a job as a stable hand and realized that even his father’s servants lived better than he did. He resolved to return home. What struck me most was this verse:

“While he was still a long way off, his father caught sight of him, and was filled with compassion.”

Missy and I are in the middle of our parenting journey. She recently shared that she sees parenting like mountain climbing—moments of rest, moments of strain, and the promise of lasting beauty. This week has been a moment to catch a breath. Abby has honored her promise to be more thoughtful about her texts and is leaning further into counseling. There are reasons to celebrate.

And yet, instead of celebrating, I find myself caught in trial. I know the road ahead is long, and I’ve been trained never to take my eye off the ball. Life doesn’t pause. On Friday, I was told that Microsoft is no longer considering me for the sales position I’ve pursued for the last three months. Disappointment led to doubt, which fueled indulgence. I retreated into self-care on Saturday. Though I went with the family to Abby’s art show and my dad’s birthday, I missed Isaac’s soccer game. Worse, I was cranky and absent in the moments that mattered.

Lord, I struggle with trusting You and with lust. Rather than investing time with my family, I found myself doomscrolling on Facebook, feeding my desire to escape, and falling into patterns I had given up for Lent. Technology fuels addiction in the same way the Devil tempts us to sin. It follows the cycle of Doubt, Lies, Desire, Sin:

- Doubt – “I can handle this. It’s just harmless entertainment.”
- Lies – “This isn’t really affecting me.”
- Desire – The algorithm exploits natural human weakness, making it harder to resist.
- Sin – Giving in to lust, addiction, or even just wasting time meant for better things.

As I scrolled, I started receiving advertisements for AI relationships. Research shows that by 2050, there will be 50 million autonomous robots in the world. Many will work, but some will provide companionship at home. Just as social media has reshaped our society, AI is poised to change how we relate to each other. Without intention, it could further distract us from You. True relationships require sacrifice, truth, and growth—AI offers an escape, a counterfeit love without accountability.

To that end, I’m giving up Facebook for the rest of Lent.  

I need to work on leaning you in the face of disappointment Lord rather than escaping.  You told me when I was laid off from Microsoft that my value does not come from what I do but instead comes from relationship with you.  You made it clear that my most important job was to help my family find you.

Lord, I need Your help to stay focused on what matters. I know my challenges are only beginning. Missy recently shared that Isaac has voiced doubts about his faith. Abby takes issue with how we are parenting Isaac, as she tries to normalize same-sex attraction. I don’t know how to walk the line between love and truth. I need Your Spirit to guide me.

As always, let Your will be done, and I thank You for Your gifts.

Amen.
