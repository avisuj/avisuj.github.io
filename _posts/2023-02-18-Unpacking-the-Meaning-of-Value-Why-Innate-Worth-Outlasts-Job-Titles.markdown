excerpt: "This post explores the true sources of value in human life, distinguishing between innate value, which is rooted in our humanity and connections with others, and bestowed value, which is based on economic or social status. I argue that appreciating and valuing each person as God-given is key to recognizing and honoring our own innate worth and that of others."

It's layoff season.  While this round, I'm safe - I've been let go twice in my career so far.  The first time I laid off it was jarring for me because I defined my value by my job.  Clearly, I'm more than my job.  I'm also a son, husband, father, community member, volunteer, church goer, gym member, mentor, and friend.  I have many roles.  I've come to realize value doesn't come from a role.  I think value is endowed by our creator - as the declaration of independence says "all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of happiness."  Besides our innate value, I think value is also bestowed by others.  I've come to believe that bestowed value is transient while innate value is permanent and real.

# Sources of Value
Value is a measure of worth.  It is observable.  I think an individual's value comes from:
- Being Human
- Providing Economic Value
- Leading Others
- Protecting Others

## Innate Value
Our core value is rooted in our humanity; in our connections, potential, and connectedness.  

We have connections with each other.  Everyone is a son, daughter, mother, or father.  Those connections can be established via blood or through deepened relationships.  Individuals are cherished and that demands respect.

We have untold potential.  Today we stand on the shoulder's of those who came before us through an arc of history that has seen life expectancy rise, wealth grow, and peace expand.  Moreover, we have control over our destiny - through our choices and our efforts we can change the path we are on.  Never underestimate a fellow human; instead show reverence because one day a human will solve a problem that today is impossible.

We are connected with each other through empathy.  Our emotions connect us.  "The sadness from which compassion springs is a pro-social emotion, an agent of connection and love" (Bittersweet).  When you see another person, try to see yourself.

## Bestowed Value
The other sources of value result from our inter personal interactions.  We ascribe value to those who provide service.  In Leaders Eat Last, Simon Sinek relates that hierarchy was established to promote societal order.  Sinek continues that a leaders value is rooted in their ability to serve the community.  

This premise is echoed through anecdote:
- Every great company starts by solving an important problem. (Startup.com)
- The best test as a leader is: Do those served grow as persons; do they become healthier, wiser, freer, more autonomous, more likely themselves to become leaders? (Robert Greenleaf)
- Being a soldier is more than courage; itâ€™s sacrificing yourself for something greater than yourself. (Anonymous)

We pay, honor, and respect those who provide service.  However, this value is ultimately fleeting.  Rich have become poor.  Politicians have become criminals.  Veterans have become homeless.  

Because bestowed value can lead to inequity, it can be easy to covet.  In warning, Simon Sinek points out that a false leader will struggle to hold on to their position once they've got it because the value of leadership comes from the people. "It is nice to be important, but it's more important to be nice." (Walter Winchell)

# Lasting Value
According to Power of Positivity, the regrets of people on their deathbed are:
- Didn't spend enough time with their family.
- Wasn't kind, patient, or loving enough.
- Should've taken more risks.
- Didn't express their feelings to loved ones or themselves.
- Didn't forgive when their was time.

As we face death, it's not bestowed value we treasure.  Instead we focus on our innate value and the innate value of those closest to us.  If there's a lesson here, I think it's to appreciate each person as God given.
