excerpt: "This reflection is a prayerful look back on a year of retrenchment and formation, where familiar measures of progress fell away and harder questions took their place: Am I loved, am I seen, does my family feel held? In stepping back from external work and ministry to tend first to home, I’ve come to see that fruit shows up quietly—in steadier relationships, deeper presence, and a slower, more trusting faith. Revisiting my personal development plan revealed not a strategy for self-improvement, but a path shaped by grace: learning what must be measured and what can only be observed, rebuilding trust in my marriage through patience rather than control, and returning to God not with urgency or performance, but with humility and availability."

Lord,

It’s been a while since I’ve written.
It’s been a while since I’ve attended a full service.

In some ways, I know I’ve failed You—not dramatically, but quietly, through drift. Still, I’m turning my face toward You again. Even in the depth of despair, I have felt Your presence, steady and unrelenting. I’m thinking again about what it means to be Your son, how to use the talents You’ve entrusted to me, and what it means to be a faithful father.

When I look back on 2025, it feels like a year of retrenchment while being formed. Not a year of progress as I once measured it, but a year of stripping away. In many ways, it felt like purgatory—lonely, disorienting, and slow. The metrics I once relied on to prove movement evaporated, leaving behind harder questions:
Do I feel loved?
Do I feel seen?
Does my family feel safe, loved, and held?

As those questions came into focus, I withdrew from many external commitments that once defined me. The Foundation slowed. Church ministries suffered. Work narrowed. This retreat wasn’t driven by apathy, but by necessity. I could not steward everything while my home needed me fully.

Your Church teaches that we know a tree by its fruit. When I apply that lens honestly, I see something quiet but real: my immediate family is stronger today than it was a year ago. Not healed. Not finished. But more honest. More grounded. More together. That is not nothing.

This morning, I spent time revisiting my personal development plan, and for the first time in a long while, it didn’t feel like an act of self-improvement. It felt like an act of trust. I could see Your grace threaded through it—a path forward that doesn’t demand urgency or performance.

I’m learning that some things require measurement: my work, my health, my discipline. And some things require observation: my marriage, my children, my interior life. Not everything sacred can be optimized. Some things must simply be tended.

I’m becoming someone who trusts You enough to slow down. Someone who stays present instead of rushing to fix. Someone who leads at home not through certainty, but through steadiness. My deepest work right now is rebuilding trust with my wife—listening without agenda, choosing patience over persuasion, and letting consistency do what arguments never could.

Work on my heart, God.
Remind me that I am chosen, not because of what I produce, but because I am Yours.
Let Your presence move through me in ways I don’t need to announce or defend.

I’m not asking You to restore everything at once. I’m asking You to stay with me as I return—carefully, honestly, and without pretending the cost didn’t matter.

I love You.
