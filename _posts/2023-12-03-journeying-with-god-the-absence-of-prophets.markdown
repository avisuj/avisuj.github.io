excerpt: "In this personal reflection, I explore the Gospel reading from Mark, contemplating the intriguing image of God as a traveler and pondering the absence of new prophets in my Catholic faith. I delve into the roles of the Holy Spirit, the anticipation of Christ's return, and my responsibility to actively bring Heaven to Earth."

In today's Gospel reading from Mark (13:33-37), the call to live in Jesus's truth at all times is a familiar theme. The majority view is clear: we should be vigilant because we don't know when the day of judgment will arrive. However, a particular image struck me – that of God as a man traveling abroad. It raises the question, where has God gone that we must await His return?

This contemplation led me to ponder the absence of new prophets. Unlike the past, the Catholic Church doesn't anticipate the arrival of new prophets conveying foundational messages. Instead, we believe in the ongoing guidance of the Holy Spirit and the authority of teachings passed down through apostolic succession.

When Jesus fulfilled the Old Testament through His death and resurrection, the veil separating God from this world was torn. Now, God, through the Holy Spirit, is with us always and everywhere. Yet, Jesus will return to judge the living and the dead. In this time of waiting, we've been given the tools to bring Heaven to Earth, charged with doing His work.

How can we be sure we're fulfilling this assignment? Judging the goodness of our actions by their fruit – examining the intent, outcome, and circumstances – provides a guide. While it may feel like we're in the shadow of the Kingdom, sources like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation's Goal Keepers Reports fill me with optimism, suggesting progress toward realizing a better world.

On a personal level, I feel called to explore the lives of the Saints as guides for my own journey. Saints are venerated for their exemplary lives, yet they aren't seen as new prophets altering fundamental doctrines. While reading about the saints may be informative, the path toward revelation, I believe, involves being still, listening for the Holy Spirit, and participating in the community to understand what has been heard.

As I navigate my faith journey, participating in ministries like Man-Up and Men's Club, I've found that investing in the community enriches my understanding of challenging Gospel messages. Through this engagement, I've come to see that, just as God is with us and still to come, we are given the charge to be His hands and feet on Earth.

In conclusion, this journey has taught me that living in God's truth is not only about anticipation but also active participation. By being vigilant, engaging in community, and discerning the fruits of our actions, we become co-creators of a world where God's presence is not just awaited but actively manifested.
