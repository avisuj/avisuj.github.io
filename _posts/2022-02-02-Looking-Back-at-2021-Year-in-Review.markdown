As I start this blog and we start 2022 - I think it's appropriate to do a look back.  I tend to track metrics focused around Financial Health and General Wellness.  A few years ago I came up with that strategy because I wasn't satisfied with just keeping track of our family budget.  I wanted to know if I was doing well.  In addition, I didn't like the idea of just focusing on money.  Having been corporate for almost fifteen years now, I'm not stranger to a balanced scorecard - so I've adopted it for my personal life.  Yes, I'm weird; but it works for me and helps me think about the progress I'm making to important goals like financial freedom, a healthy marriage, a spiritually centered life, and a healthy lifestyle.  My KPI's are pretty straight forward:
- Net Worth
- Return on Assets
- Investment Performance against Market
- Weight
- Muscle Mass
- Body Fat Percentage
- Waist Line
- Date Nights
- Books Read
- Church Attendance

At a high level, 2021 was pretty good for me. In some ways, I'm still struggling to get re-centered after the pandemic. Likewise, the last few months have been stressful as I've started a new role professionally. All that said, I think I'm incredibly blessed and feel well positioned to have some really great years ahead of me. Let's double click on my financial health and wellness.

## Financial Health
Over the last three years, my net worth has doubled. While that's basically the same rate as the market, I think that's amazing. Broadly, it's become apparent that I'm building five major nest eggs:

| Category | Percent of Assets |
| --- | --- |
| Retirement | 53% | 
| College Savings | 9% |
| Equities | 15% |
| Real Estate | 3% |
| Crypto | 5% | 

Last year my income increased by thirty seven percent. That growth was primarily driven from windfall crypto investments and the increase in the Microsoft stock price.  Both of these one time sources of income have given me pause because **this year my income will decrease by forty percent**. 

That has brought forward a new priority for me: Generate Passive Income. To accomplish that, I've started to increase my investments in Real Estate and Crypto:
- Real Estate: I'm invested in [First National Realty Partners](https://www.fnrpusa.com "A Commercial Real Estate Private Equity Firm"). We live in a condo; as such our real estate exposure in our home is limited.  In order to increase our exposure to real estate, I started investing in FNRP. Historically they have returned 8% per year from properties they manage. 
- Crypto: Three years ago, I spent $500 for a Helium Hotspot. The hotspot mines about a $10 per day in crypto while funneling a small portion of my bandwidth to enable the Helium IoT service. After basically ignoring the hotspot for three years, I woke up one day to find that I had a stock pile of nearly $70K in Crypto.  That got me started me on an adventure in decentralized finance.  

Net, last year was incredible financially.  In order to continue outsized performance, I'm betting on Real Estate and Crypto.  In fact, within five years I'm expecting my investments in Equities, Real Estate, and Crypto to be balanced at 10% each.  I've learned from my financial advisor, [Personal Capital](https://pcap.link/avinashsujee "A Dedicated Team To Help Clients Reach Their Financial Goals"), that having a balanced portfolio of different asset classes is a way of ensuring that I buy low and sell high.

## Wellness
While I struggled last year with physical fitness, my other measures around reading, going to church, and going on dates with my wife all improved from the year before.  

I went on a focused tear in the spring time -- which is pretty consistent for me.  I like many other people struggle in the winter.  Currently, I'm incredibly thankful that the days are getting longer and warmer.  

As I look at what I accomplished last year, I feel like with a little more focus I can do better at achieving balance.  I think the best way to get to that outcome is to forgive myself for the past and just start to show up.  The last time I really felt "on top of it" was prior to the pandemic -- although I must say last year felt a lot better than 2020.

## TLDR
In summary, I'm really pleased with the way last year turned out.  While there's always some room for improvement, I think I'll be doing quite well if 2022 resembles 2021.  In addition, I think I'm on the right path in my personal, professional, and financial life.
