## The Problem 
I joined [ResponsiveOrg](https://www.responsive.org/manifesto) in 2015.  The group itself is an outreach of the work I was doing for Yammer.  It articulated a positive view of the future of work:

> Responsive Organizations are designed to thrive in less predictable environments by balancing the following tensions: 
> 
> | More Predictable <-> Less Predictable | 
> | :---: | 
> | Profit <-> Purpose | 
> | Hierarchies <-> Networks | 
> | Controlling <-> Empowering | 
> | Planning <-> Experimentation | 
> | Privacy  <-> Transparency | 

The coalition shared examples of how organizations were trying to become more responsive through technology, engagement, and organization.  The reason organizations needed to change was tied back to do some work John Hagel and John Brown had done in 2010 called the [Shift Index](https://edgeperspectives.com/bigshift.html).  They noted that since 1965, return on assets[^1] had been steadily declining.  In contrast, over the same period employee productivity has been steadily increasing.  

[^1]: Return on assets is calculated as: <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=ROA = \frac{Income}{Total Assets}">

While we are working harder, we are working on things that don't matter.  More particularly, we are working on things that give us smaller incremental improvements rather than disruptive things that lead to step change outcomes.  There are many possibilities of why this is the case:
- The more assets you have the harder it is to generate value.  When I graduated from college, our family had no assets.  The salary that I made was many multiples of the assets at our disposal.  As we started to build a nest egg, it became harder to sustain that growth because while we have more assets to put to work, I didn't have more time to manage them.  Eventually, time becomes our most limited asset.
- Being human we have strong loss aversion which drives us to pay attention to the wrong things.  Rather than focusing on our most limited asset, we spend our time trying to drive a one or two percentage point increases on the stock market trying to eak out incremental improvements by being more productive.
- What we measure is what we get done.  It's easy to observe if we're doing as well as the market, it's much harder to observe if we're working on the right things to lead to a Good Life.  

From 2015, I started tracking my return on assets annually.  I wanted to understand if I was working on the right things financially.  From 2016 to 2020, I took hands on approach to managing my 401K while seeking an investment advisor to help me manage my money market accounts and IRA's.  Over that period of time my 401K increased by 260% while the market grew by 168%.  The more assets you have the harder it is to generate value.  Masked in those returns is a significant portal of growth came from income.  For the last several years, I've maxed out my 401K investments and IRA contributions at $30K/year.  Since I'm now at the cap, reality has taken hold and my ROA forecasts are steadily declining.  I have to do something different.

## Smart Weighting
In 2020, I was approached by [Personal Capital](https://pcap.link/avinashsujee).  The investment philosophy that Personal Capital uses is [Smart Weighting](https://www.personalcapital.com/wealth-management/smart-weighting).  The basic premise is to identify invest equally in sectors that have unique characteristics and minimal correlation and then re-balance regularly.  As a result, a hot sector doesn't become overweight because you sell more.  Likewise, a cold sector doesn't become underweight because you buy more.  As a consequence of this approach, buying low and selling high is built into the system.  

Personal Capital will argue that this approach is better than buying low-cost ETF's like ^SPY.  In order to audit that claim, I've tracked my annual returns on my investment accounts since 2020.  Over that period, my equity investment increased by 23% while the market increased by 21%.  In the prior period, my equity investments increased by 217% while the market increased by 33%.  I've netted that they are doing about the same of the market.  By leveraging them, I've been able to free up time which I'm primarily using to manage higher growth investments and passive income streams.  Ultimately, The only way I'm going to get close to returning to 217% growth over a two year period is by increasing the income I'm bringing in.  

Learning from Personal Capital - I've decided to view my nest egg as four major investment classes: retirement, equity investment, crypto, and real estate.  I've decided to make an active effort to try to balance my equity, real estate, and crypto investments.  The time I'm not using to manage my stocks, I'm now using to investigate new startups and technology trends.  If my forecast holds, I will have grown my passive income from $700 to $51,000 in five years.  My ROA will continue to be over 15% even while my assets double.  

## Real Estate Exposure
While my passion for Crypto has been self-evident; I'm going to expound on my journey within real estate.  Over the last two years, real estate has been hot.  My home has appreciated by 200%.  Last year, I signed up for [Status Financial](https://statusmoney.com/?ref=KomJNO) to try to understand how I was spending my income in comparison to my peers.  It quickly stood out to me, that most of my peers had larger homes.  We're happy with our house.  It's a condo so we don't spend much if any time on outdoor maintenance.  It's in a great school district.  We don't want to move.  Further, because our house is smaller we spend less on it.  We've been able to use those savings to fund a month long vacation annually as well as membership in a boat club which we use most weekends.  It works for us.

I believe that real estate is tried and proven way to build wealth.  In order to increase my real estate exposure without buying a bigger house, I started looking at different real estate hedge funds.  I ended up choosing [First National Realty Partners](https://fnrpusa.com/).  I picked them because:
- They primarily invested in Grocery Stores.  I don't think Grocery Stores will be heavily disrupted by technology as proximity matters for freshness.
- They let you specifically invest in a particular property; you could learn about the neighborhood they were investing in.
- They are full service - their value chain includes finding, repairing, renting, and selling property.  They have expertise in the area as opposed to just being a financial play.
- Their investments have some tax advantage as the repair costs are tax deductible and passed to investors.

## TLDR;
I think I'll be able to hit my financial growth goals by keeping a smart weighting on equity, crypto, and real estate investments.  Ultimately, I think the proof will be in the pudding.  In the near term, I'm grateful that I'm able to do more work on the technological frontiers of our society.  If things do work out, I think I'll be able to self-fund some charitable giving aspirations that I have.
