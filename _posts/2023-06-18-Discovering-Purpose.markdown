Reflecting on personal experiences, I highlight the three stages of economic life, emphasizing the importance of self-discovery, resource building, and leaving a meaningful legacy.

Starting things is hard.  Over the last month I know the time I've been putting into the Sujeeth Foundation has taken away from family.  I hope to share with you why I'm investing in this way. 

The Sujeeth Foundation is an organization that tries to help students unlock the opportunity of education. Some years ago, we has the fortune to come into some unexpected money.  We were able to award a scholarship which encouraged a friend to get her masters.  Education changed our life - the idea that we can use education to help others change their lives is empowering.

I've come to believe that economic life has three stages:
- Early Career - This is the messy process of discovering your interests and identifying your Ikigai.  I navigated this through experimentation, education, growth mindset, and self reflection.
- Mid Life - This is about marshaling the resources you have built to sustain yourself as you try to preserve time.  As I've gotten older, I've learned to appreciate time as a finite resource.  This involves growing total assets and generating free cash flow.  The stock market is an excellent vehicle to grow assets.  Business and real estate are great vehicles to increase cash flow.
- End Life - This is about establishing a legacy.  For me, I think it will be about how I'm connected with others, the impact I've had and how people will remember me.  You die twice - the day you die and the day people no longer remember your name. 

Last Sunday at church, I hear a great framework for evaluating works:
- Good Action: Good action refers to engaging in morally upright and beneficial behaviors. It involves acting in ways that are considered morally right, just, and fair. 
- Good Intention: Good intention refers to the underlying motivation or purpose behind an action. It involves having virtuous motives and a genuine desire to do good. When someone acts with good intention, they are guided by ethical principles, such as empathy, compassion, fairness, and a sense of moral responsibility.
- Good Consequence: Good consequence refers to the positive outcomes or results that arise from an action. It recognizes that the impact of our actions can have far-reaching effects on others and society. Good consequences are those that promote well-being, create happiness, and contribute to the greater good. 

I've had a few concerns around the foundation:
- Is this only about legacy?
- Is this God's calling?
- Is this effective? 

When you start something you are testing a value population with a community you are trying to serve.  While it seems like it would be easy to award a regular scholarship, some of the other things I'm doing with the foundation are more tenuous.  For example, are students looking for guidance on how to unlock value from education or are they just looking for financial assistance?  From that questions stems a flood of others including:
- Will people choose to apply?
- Will people order the books I recommend?
- Will those books make material impact on how people approach life?
- Will people join Circles?
- Will people donate or volunteer?

I believe if I'm truly serving people and making a difference in someone's life these questions will work themselves out. Originally, I had planned to do the work on the foundation until after I had retired.  Waiting doesn't answer questions.  Waiting burns time you will never get back.  Waiting reduces your ability to react by delaying your opportunities for learning.

I prayed about it.  I concluded we had an opportunity to try now.  Through this process, I hope to learn if I'm really able to make an impact.  Maybe I'll find a better way to drive even more impact.  Regardless, I think what I learn will be valuable in efforts that I'm not even aware of.  In the end, it's in God's hands.  I will be open to go where he calls me.
