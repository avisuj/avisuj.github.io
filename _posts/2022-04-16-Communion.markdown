excerpt: "In Communion, I talk about my faith journey.  Specifically I try to answer: +Why I chose Catholicism when my wife was Episcopal and my mother was Hindu? +If I'm leading my children to be Catholic, why have I not gotten baptized? +How do I resolve my liberal beliefs around abortion and homosexuality with the Catechism of the Church?"

While I've talked about religion in the past, I haven't deeply gone into my spiritual journey.  I'm going to in this post because I think it will be useful for me to resolve some apparent contradictions that from the outside maybe confusing.  For example:
 - Why did I choose Catholicism when my wife was Episcopal and my mother was Hindu?
 - If I'm leading my children to be Catholic, why have I not gotten baptized?
 - How do I resolve my liberal beliefs around abortion and homosexuality with the Catechism of the Church?

# God is Love
I am an unbaptized Catholic.  I've had the privilege of having broad exposure to faiths: Catholicism, Protestantism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, and Islam.  As I strove to understand God, I found Christ's message of love compelling.  I believe the two greatest commandments are: "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind. . . [and] You shall love your neighbor as yourself" (Catechism of the Catholic Church).  

When I envision love, I imagine acceptance, protection, and warmth.  As Paul describes, 
> Love is patient, love is kind.  It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.  It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no records of wrongs.  Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.  It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.  Love never fails (Corinthians 12:31 - 13:13).

Love is creation, reconciliation, and grace.  Love is a virtue worth cherishing.  A God who loves is balm to the imperfect.  I feel God's love when I see the awesome, see the holy, see the beautiful, and prey to God; for me it feels like energy goes through me creating a warm buzz in my brain.  I remember first having this experience while attending mass in high school.  I remember associating the feeling with God during a senior retreat called Kairos, a three day student led retreat about self-discovery and developing a personal relationship with God.  At one point in the retreat, we were provided letters from friends and family that we read and shared with others.  I was surprised to receive a letter from my parents; my high school years were tumultuous as my emo self struggled with a feeling of unworthiness that was complicated by untreated depression.  I didn't think I had earned my parents love.  In the letter, my parents acknowledged the strife we had experienced but reinforced that they were proud of me and loved me.  In that moment, I felt God.

Over the last few weeks, I've been dealing with a depression flare-up that has encouraged me to face feelings of shame and worthlessness.  At one point, I called my doctor to describe thoughts of suicide and the nurse who answered commended me for being aware that the feelings were irrational.  Love centers me; I know my family, friends, and God loves me.  I've learned to trust that love as a flashlight in the darkness and use it to separate reality from what I feel in depression.

Perhaps because of my own struggles, I also understand the value of shared suffering.  In a world of God's love, we are still far away from heaven on earth.  There is pain; sometimes attributable to free will and at other times, as with childhood cancer, seemingly unexplainable.  To me, the idea that God would choose to experience our suffering in order to model what we should strive for reflects a love that's observable through sacrifice.
> God has honored you. The gospel is the story of how he did it. At the heart of the story is the word servant. Jesus Christ became your servant. . . When Jesus voluntarily became your servant, he lowered himself and elevated you (Shame Interrupted).

When we were looking for churches, Missy and I started looking at Episcopal churches.  I noticed some very small differences in the church; probably the most obvious was the focus on the Cross as opposed to the Crucifix.  In philosophy and religious studies in College, I learned to pay attention to these differences.  Differences can help you understand what people have experienced in the past.  For example, the Gospel of Mathew's focus on lineage contrasts with the Gospel of Luke's unique parables speak to their respective audiences, Jews and Gentiles.  Whitewashing differences denies individuals their truth, limits our ability to empathize, and prevents our ability to seek justice.  We all have a past.  While our past doesn't control our future, it does need to be recognized.  Similarly, the focus on the Cross verse Crucifix reflects a theological focus on the resurrection or the passion.  Acceptance of suffering is an important message for me; significant enough that I had a strong preference for the Catholic Church.  

# unbaptized catholic
So if I'm an unapologetic Catholic, why don't I get baptized?  To be honest, I'm looking forward to re-evaluating this decision in counseling.  In the past, I've decided not to get baptized because my mom would prefer if I didn't.  

When my mom first found out I was thinking about converting, she took to me India to learn more about Hinduism.  I learned the core Hindu values are:
- Brahman - The One God.
- Atman - God's expression of creation that exists in individuals.  There is God in all of us.
- Dharma - The essence of God that makes an individual.  By honoring our essence, we can become one with God.
- Karma - A connective experience that unites all of our individual lives and gives us the ability to reunite with the One God.

I envision the God of Hinduism as a loving light.  Through love, light creates.  Creation retains a portion of the One God's light that can be realized when the individual lives in a way that is consistent with God's essence.  Upon death, the individual rejoins God unless something they experienced in their current life blocks them.  In the event they are blocked, they are shown mercy and given an opportunity to try again in a new life.  

As my mom pointed out to me, that core belief structure is compatible with following Jesus Christ as a Guru.  In fact, there was a portrait of Jesus in the Hare Krishna Hare Rama temple that Missy and I got married in (for those keeping track Missy and I have been married four times).  Several of my family members have a portrait of Jesus on their personal altars.  It's a type of whitewashing that acknowledges the message of love Jesus preached while ignoring his Jewish heritage.  

As I've grown older my mom's objections to conversion have varied; but ultimately it boils down to she's concerned about the judgement of our family and her community.  To date, I have chosen to honor my mother wishes.  I have participated in the church by attending weekly without receiving sacraments.  In this way, I am trying to model behavior for my children as they grow up in the church.  One day, I'll likely get baptized and join my family fully in the church.

In December 2020, I reached out to friends on Facebook because I was struggling with the news that the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops was considering denying Joe Biden communion on the basis of his pro-choice position.  

Abortion is a serious decision that is often made in imperfect situations where there isn't a good option.  I had a friend who found she was pregnant six months into a relationship with an older man.  She wasn't ready to be a mother and their relationship wasn't stable enough to raise a child.  After discussing the pregnancy with her partner, she decided to get an abortion.  I saw the way that decision impacted her and the pain she went through during the procedure.  It wasn't easy.  I'm glad that I didn't have to face that decision.  I supported my friend the best I could by being present and not judging her.

Nearly one out of three single mothers in the United States live in poverty.  It's not easy; as a society we don't provide access to affordable child care and many jobs don't provide the flexibility single mothers need.  We can do better and if we did I'm convinced abortions would decrease.  In fact, I think aid programs explain the correlation between Democratic presidents and the decrease in abortion rates.  

The Catholic church is clear that abortion is evil.  My experience with abortion reflects that, abortion hurts everyone involved and should not be celebrated.  As with most impossible decisions, I think the decision should be made by the people directly involved.  The church states: 
> A person who procures a completed abortion incurs excommunication latae sententiae, by the very commission of the offense . . . The moment a positive law deprives a category of human beings of the protection which civil legislation ought to accord them, the state is denying the equality of all before the law. When the state does not place its power at the service of the rights of each citizen, and in particular of the more vulnerable, the very foundations of a state based on law are undermined (Catechism of the Catholic Church).

At the same token, the church provides for legitimate defense:
> The legitimate defense of persons and societies is not an exception to the prohibition against the murder of the innocent that constitutes intentional killing. “The act of self-defense can have a double effect: the preservation of one’s own life; and the killing of the aggressor. The one is intended, the other is not.”  Love toward oneself remains a fundamental principle of morality. Therefore it is legitimate to insist on respect for one’s own right to life (Catechism of the Catholic Church).

Further even grave sins can be forgiven:
> Certain particularly grave sins incur excommunication, the most severe ecclesiastical penalty, which impedes the reception of the sacraments and the exercise of certain ecclesiastical acts, and for which absolution consequently cannot be granted, according to canon law, except by the Pope, the bishop of the place or priests authorized by them (Catechism of the Catholic Church).

Besides abortion, I struggle with the churches teachings on homosexuality.  I find the call for abstinence unrealistic and inappropriate.  I take solace that church also says:
> The number of men and women who have deep-seated homosexual tendencies is not negligible. This inclination, which is objectively disordered, constitutes for most of them a trial. They must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity. Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided. These persons are called to fulfill God’s will in their lives and, if they are Christians, to unite to the sacrifice of the Lord’s Cross the difficulties they may encounter from their condition (Catechism of the Catholic Church).

My eight grade religious teacher was gay.  I'm grateful for him.  Two lessons stood out to me:
- He related a story from his grandmother who asked him when he had cut himself, "what color is your blood?"  When he answered red, his grandmother reminded him that regardless of difference everyone's blood is red.
- He pointed out to the class that homosexuality maybe viewed as a sin but so was birth control and masturbation.  

Indeed, the Church's teachings identify that I'm in a sinful relationship with my wife because I've had vasectomy:
> “every action which, whether in anticipation of the conjugal act, or in its accomplishment, or in the development of its natural consequences, proposes, whether as an end or as a means, to render procreation impossible” is intrinsically evil (Catechism of the Catholic Church).

While I struggle with the teachings, I pray for discernment:
- to understand if the focus on abortion and homosexuality is misplaced in the context of Christ's teachings 
- to understand if, like Judas, I'm trying to exert my will over God's will.  

When you join a community based on values, you don't get to opt out of values that you struggle with.  I recognize that the decision making power on church teachings rest with the clergy.  At the same time, even a piece criticizing Cardinal Marx's challenge of the Catechism recognized:
> The Catechism isn’t above question or critique, but such inquiries should challenge not what the Catechism teaches but, rather, how it teaches it. The Catechism is, after all, for catechesis, and as such it can fall short in conveying what the Church has established, but this does not affect the holy tradition of truth behind it.

I think of Jesus going to prostitutes, going to lepers, and going to adulterers.  I find it hard to believe that Jesus would shun people for these violations of the Ten Commandments.  As the catechism says, "it is in the New Covenant in Jesus Christ that their [The Ten Commandments] full meaning would be revealed" (Catechism of the Catholic Church).  Ultimately, I think it's up to the sinner to resolve his or her sin with God through reconciliation.  Regardless, sin does not grant me the power to judge others.  Likewise, sin does not give me the power to deny others love; one cannot be too stingy with love.

# why stay
I think as the Church's sex abuse crisis has shown, the Church is not without sin.  We are all doing our best to live a Good Life that was modeled by Jesus Christ.  In 2022, there's a great deal of sorting that serves to isolate ourselves from diverse perspectives.  Rather than respectfully engaging with people we disagree with, we quit.  I think it's a tragedy that weaponizes our differences.  It's certainly not in alignment with the vision of the church as a field hospital for sinners.  I think the struggle with these issues, like a knife grinding on a whetstone, can make the community and individuals better.  I'm confident that the church's teachings have made me a better person, a better father, and a better husband.  In addition, as a member of the church if I can help someone feel welcome, who otherwise would feel threatened out of place, then I feel like I'm doing God's work.
