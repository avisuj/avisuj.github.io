excerpt: "In my blog post, I reflect on the pending layoff at Microsoft and stress the importance of realizing that my value is not solely tied to my job. I share how I've embraced change, explored transferable skills, and maintained resilience during this challenging time. Being present with my family and executing plans with a positive mindset have helped me grow and set an example for my children."

While I was on vacation, my network started discussing a pending reorganization at Microsoft.  It quickly became clear that my role was likely to be impacted.  On July 10th, my skip manager asked me to join a team call with HR to officially deliver the news.  

Bad things sometimes happen to good people.  I think a person's character is defined by how they react - how they get back up and learn from past experiences.  I wanted to illustrate to the kids: that a person's value is not defined by their job, that it's important to be present with people, and that resilience happens by executing plans with the end in mind. 

To begin, a person's value is not defined by their job.  While it's common knowledge, I think it can be harder to realize because salary and rewards are some of the most visible signs of value.   In fact, I think value comes from being human, economic value, leading others, and protecting others [Unpacking the Meaning of Value: Why Innate Worth Outlasts Job Titles](https://blog.avisuj.com/integrity/heart/legacy/parenting/Unpacking-the-Meaning-of-Value-Why-Innate-Worth-Outlasts-Job-Titles/).  My life has started to reflect this as I've changed my identity from a Microsoft employee to a Catholic, a Father, and a Technologist.  

Because my identity isn't my job, I'm able to reflect on transferable skills and employment as a way of generating I'm economic value.  In fact, I don't feel threatened by the lay-off instead I see it for what it is - a bet by company leadership that the job I was doing can be distributed to other employees who are augmented by Artificial Intelligence.  I can even appreciate that Microsoft is trying to live what it sells and I'll be interested to see if this value proposition for generative artificial intelligence can actually be realized.  

I am still the same person I was before the lay-off.  I still own the relationships I've built over the years.  I have unique skills that I leverage to serve others.

Moreover it's important to be present with people.  When we got the news, Missy asked if we should cancel the vacation.  I didn't think that was a good idea because the vacation is a great opportunity to spend time together as a family.  I will always treasure the fishing memories from the trip and I hope we'll have more time to explore that past time.  While I did take some time out to stake out job opportunities, I tried to box the time that I would spend so that I could be present with the family on the vacation.  While I'm sure I did better some days than others, being present was always top of mind.

Lastly, resilience happens by executing plans with the end in mind.  Having been laid off, I know one of the biggest challenges with being unemployed is the lack of structure.  I'm trying to illustrate through my search how to deconstruct a problem and develop tactics to address it.  Like with exercise, showing up every day is the clearest path to success.

Layoffs are an aspect of today's business world.  My character is defined by how I deal with adversity.  This gives me the opportunity to model behaviors that I hope my kids can embrace.
