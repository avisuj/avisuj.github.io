excerpt: "This year has been a journey of growth, anchored by faith, family, and community. My baptism during Easter deepened my commitment to God, teaching me to love my family as they are and trust in His plan. Challenges within the family, including Abby's struggles, highlighted the importance of patience, listening, and unity, while community engagements like the Sujeeth Foundation and St. Vincent DePaul reinforced the value of service and impact. Looking ahead, I aim to strengthen my faith, nurture my family, and expand opportunities for community growth, all with God at the center."

For me, the purpose of the year-end review is to reflect and discern if I am truly living in alignment with God’s purpose for me and making the best use of the resources I have been given. *For to everyone who has, more will be given* (Matthew 25:29). With this in mind, I examine my life through my core priorities: faith, family, and community.

# Faith
This year, I took a significant step in my faith journey: I was baptized during Easter. While I have long been a believer, this moment marked a transformation. It helped me realize that faith is not meant to be a solitary experience but something to be expressed with and for others. At its heart, faith is rooted in love—the love of a father for his son, God’s love for His chosen, and the love we offer to God and one another. This realization has prompted me to reflect deeply on how I express love, especially within my family, which I recognize as my immediate apostolate.

One of the hardest lessons I’ve faced is that love does not mean control. I am learning to be weak in spirit, to submit my will to those I love, and to trust God’s plan. In the past, I tried to balance priorities, often making a mess of family dynamics. I worry that we, as a family, sometimes invent moral compasses rather than submitting to God’s. If anyone can fix the messes I’ve created, it is the Lord.

Through prayer, reconciliation, and adoration, the message this year has been clear: love my family as they are and entrust them to God. Fully listening, holding patience, avoiding judgment, and trusting in God’s timing—these actions require me to stretch in ways that are uncomfortable but necessary.

# Family
This year has been a struggle but also an opportunity for growth. Abby began cutting in September, reflecting their personal struggles with anxiety, self-discovery, and questions about sexuality and gender identity. These challenges have tested our family dynamics, particularly as faith has taken a more central role in our lives. Abby’s decision to stop attending church has been heartbreaking, but I am reminded to love them as they are, trust God, and practice patience as He works within our family.

Missy and I have had to confront differences in our perspectives on discipline, aspirations, faith, and acceptance. While disagreements have surfaced, they have also taught us the importance of building stronger listening skills. We are learning to respect each other’s emotions, ask clarifying questions, and rebuild trust. Our relationship remains rooted in love, and we are committed to growing as partners through these challenges.

# Community
My involvement in the community this year has been both rewarding and grounding. Here are some highlights:

- **Planet Technologies**: I am grateful for the opportunity to stay connected to the Microsoft community and help clients realize value from technology. While I achieved 75% of my quota last year, my focus on delegating and prospecting has paid off, with 200% pipeline coverage for the coming year.

- **Sujeeth Foundation**: Through our partnership with the University of Missouri, we supported 300 college juniors in the Career Circle program, helping them navigate career choices. Our Four-Star Program pairs students with mentors to foster ownership of their career paths. Notably, 90% of participants reported they had not previously engaged with their university’s career center, highlighting our program’s impact.

- **Saint Vincent DePaul**: Missy and I resumed volunteering, focusing on intake rather than home visits. Helping neighbors in need provides perspective and reminds me of the importance of service.

- **RCIA, Exodus 90, Reach More**: These communities have strengthened my relationship with God. While I look forward to investing in others as they have invested in me, for now, they offer me much-needed spiritual nourishment.

- **Men’s Ministries**: I stepped back from several fellowship groups to focus on family. I hope to reengage meaningfully in the new year.

- **YMCA**: Biking to the gym has been a rewarding routine. While I scaled back in December to prioritize rest, I’m stronger and faster than I’ve been in years. I aim to maintain this momentum.
