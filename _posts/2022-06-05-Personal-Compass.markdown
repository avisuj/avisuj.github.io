excerpt: "It's easy to get lost in a meme.  It's easy to respond to snark with sarcasm.  It's much harder to learn from those that disagree with you.  It's harder to listen with curiosity.  In this blog post I talk about how I use mental models to deconstruct labels into implied values.  By staying curious, by leveraging the Holy Spirit to listen, I think my life is more rewarding because I can search for God in others and turn them into my teachers."

This weekend I had the opportunity to attend Pentecost mass at St. Xavier, the college church at St. Louis University.  The reflection after the mass encouraged celebrants to engage in Holy Spirit listening.  Because we're often short of time, listening feels like a last art.  The leader of reflection related a story:  she attended a conference on listening and was reminded as our culture has embraced tribalism we've separated into two groups that reflect identity instead of just politics.  She recognized that she was afflicted as the speaker shared symbols associated with each group: 
- a MAGA cap
- a Black Lives Matter poster
- a Rainbow flag
- the Confederate flag

Because we're short for time, we talk in terms of labels; but like on a cup of soup, the label isn't the same as the contents.  When we see a label we disagree with, we can stop listening especially if it triggers us.   In Thanks for the Feedback, Stone and Heen state that a common reason feedback is rejected is because it fires a truth trigger, a relationship trigger, or an identity trigger.  

I feel this being liberal in Texas.  There are many times I'm at my kitchen table reminding my family that our neighbors can be good people even if they vote differently then us.  In fact, Daniel Pink shares in the Power of Regret that many of our moral differences occur "because one group has a narrower view of morality (don’t harm or cheat other people) and the other has a wider view (don’t harm or cheat other people—but also stay loyal to your group, heed authority, and uphold the sacred)."

In order to tap into "Holy Spirit Listening", I think it's very important to understand what you personally believe and to be curious.  

As I planned for a job change earlier this year, I did some [reflection](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-core-values-integrity-heart-avi-sujeeth/?trackingId=Pd7VT73wG7D1OiJXKF46JA%3D%3D) on my core values: integrity and heart.  For me, it's important to be my full-self in every aspect of my life.  When I see an apparent contradiction in my life or find others who have different values, I try to respond with curiosity - to seek to understand - to Holy Spirit Listen.

I've adopted framework's across my political, religious, and science beliefs that I try glue together through rationalization into a tapestry that reflects my values.  The frameworks help me understand what I believe and what those beliefs state about my values - they become my personal compass.  Broadly I believe:
- Politics is a social contract for the distribution of power.
- Religion is a faith based expression of morality. 
- Science is a way of exploring the truth.

# Politics
Human beings are social creatures.  In "Why Leaders Eat Last" Simon Sinek states early in our existence we learned that we were more effective with outside dangers by working together.  Through specialization and cooperation, we were able to thrive and ultimately change our conditions to suite our needs, creating a world of surplus.  

As we went from groups of 150 people, to city states, to nations - we needed a social compact on how power was distributed.  Our political systems distribute power across dimensions of representativeness and arbitrariness.  Our economic systems distribute resources across dimensions of control and centralization.

Living in the United States, I think a governments effectiveness can be measured by the degree that it empowers all of its constituents to pursue life, liberty and happiness.  Often times, I think that means a government must be able to balance the sometimes conflicted needs of constituents in a way that is perceived as just and fair.  I believe systems that distribute power through the rule of law tend to be more resilient over time.

The framework allows me to go beyond the label associated with a government or an economic system to attempt to understand the values they represent.  When I find people who disagree with me, I try to be curious as to why they disagree:
- Does Communism mean something different to them?
- Are they advocating for the Rule of Power?
- Do they see a major value different between elected leaders and declared leaders?

The framework helps me go deeper.  

# Religion
As an objectivist, I believe that moral truths exist.  I think living in alignment with these moral truths is living a Good Life. I think religion provides instruction around the moral truths and consequently makes it easier to live a Good Life.  As willing collaborators in God's plan, we gain freedom from sin through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.  Jesus calls us to love and in love we find our purpose.  

I also think that is possible to live a Good Life by embracing a virtuous mindset regardless of faith.  For example, humanists are concerned with living a Good Life and will leverage the scientific method to reason what a Good Life looks like.

The major religions have cultural codes that are captured in their texts, rituals, norms, and beliefs.  Rather than simply dismissing points of view I disagree with, I try to understand it in the full context of the religion.  I also try to evaluate if I think another religion more accurately describes what I believe to be morally true.   As US Bishops have started to deny communion to politicians for supporting the legalization of abortion, I've spent time reading the catechism, considering my beliefs, and talking to religious leaders and mentors.  In my microcosm, I have found that the Catholic Church continues to best reflect what I consider moral truth and my beliefs are also consistent with church teachings.

# Science
In his master class, Neil deGrasse Tyson describes the scientific method as "a problem solving approach that helps you glean reliable evidence in support of a hypothesis."  It allows scientists to test ideas in the effort to identify the truth.  Scientists share and repeat these tests until there is no need to keep doing so.  After a test is completed, it is published in terms dictated by the scientific method:
- observation
- questions
- hypothesis
- experiment
- result
- conclusion

This process allows for independent validation that roots out bias and mistakes.  I believe the truth discovered through the scientific method is useful like a landmark is to a person on voyage; it points to the right direction.  Therefore, I think it's important to reconcile what we learn through science with my political and religious beliefs as it helps ensure that I'm actually making progress to the Good Life.

# Summary
It's easy to get lost in a meme.  It's easy to respond to snark with sarcasm.  It's much harder to learn from those that disagree with you.  It's harder to listen with curiosity.  I use mental models as a way to deconstruct labels into implied values.  By staying curious, by leveraging the Holy Spirit to listen, I think my life is more rewarding because I can search for God in others and turn them into my teachers.
