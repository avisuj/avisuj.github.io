excerpt: "Lately I’ve been facing something uncomfortable: I’ve been treating my relationship with God like a transaction. Show me a miracle so I can trust You. Fix this situation so I know You’re here. But the Beatitudes reminded me that faith isn’t an exchange—it’s a posture. I’ve been trying to control outcomes in my family, hoping I could strategize my way to healing. But God doesn’t bless control. He blesses the poor in spirit. The mourners. The meek. The ones willing to walk the long way. Presence has to come before truth. You don’t earn trust from the stands—you step onto the field, take a hit, and stay when it gets hard. Sometimes evangelism looks like staying in the tension instead of escaping it. Staying in the silence. Staying with the hurt. Staying long enough for grace to do what strategy can’t. I’m learning to trust the God who writes in crooked lines—even when I can’t see the ending. If you’re in a season where outcomes feel out of reach, maybe the invitation isn’t to push harder. Maybe it’s simply to stay."

Dear Lord,

Blessed are you, King of the Universe, who provides shelter I cannot see.

Two years ago at Man Up I finally admitted I have a control problem. I’m competent, capable, and I know how to marshal people to deliver outcomes. But the Beatitudes don’t bless outcomes—they bless posture, hunger, surrender, and the courage to walk the long way.

> Blessed are the poor in spirit…
> Blessed are those who mourn…
> Blessed are the meek…
> Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness…
> Blessed are the merciful…
> Blessed are the clean of heart…
> Blessed are the peacemakers…
> Blessed are those persecuted for righteousness…

Somewhere along the way I reduced our relationship to a negotiation. Show me a miracle so I can trust You.
But You never invited me into a transaction—you invited me into a journey.

And in the chaos of my family right now, I keep trying to game the ending instead of staying present in the middle. I want the healing to look linear. I want clarity on demand. But You seem to be writing in crooked lines, and the only real invitation is to witness—not to control.

I’m trying to understand what “poor in spirit” looks like when I still have human needs. I know my lower-order needs are met. But my higher-order ones—attachment, security, belonging—feel painfully unmet. And You’ve been teaching me something uncomfortable but true:
- Avoiding a need out of fear is cowardice.
- Deferring a need out of love is holiness.

Presence precedes truth. You can’t preach from the stands. You have to walk onto the field, take a hit, bleed with the team. Only then does collaboration become welcome.

My fears keep surfacing:
- I fear abandonment.
- I fear not being enough.
- I fear being fundamentally broken.

And so my corresponding needs flare up:
- I need to feel chosen.
- I need to witness something real to fight back my self-doubt.
- I need evidence that I matter.

But You remind me:
> “Consider the lilies…”
> “If God so clothes the grass of the field… will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?” (Matthew 6:28–30)

Sometimes evangelism is not leaving—it’s staying. Staying in a hard marriage session. Staying in a wounded child’s silence. Staying in conversations that feel like walking a tightrope with no net. Staying allows grace to seep into the cracks we can’t fix.

The Gospel gives us a way to live today—in the scarcity, the hurt, the ache—not just a roadmap out of it.

So Lord, help me follow where You lead, not where I wish You’d lead.
Help me trust that the tomb is empty even when I can’t see daylight for myself.
Help me believe You’re still in the room, even when all I see are crooked lines.

Amen.
