excerpt: "My post on the new year doesn't adequately capture the frustration I feel around 2022.  I did the right things but indicators around my health are neutral at best.  Compared to 2021, I was 45% more active.  How is it that you can exercise more yet have many of the signals of your cardio vascular age (hrv, cholesterol, lipids) fall out of control?"

My post on the new year doesn't adequately capture the frustration I feel around 2022.  I did the right things but indicators around my health are neutral at best.  Compared to 2021, I was 45% more active.  How is it that you can exercise more yet have many of the signals of your cardio vascular age (hrv, cholesterol, lipids) fall out of control?

To me, it’s a signal of one of few possibilities:
	• I'm working on the wrong things with regards to my health.  In effect, I'm trying to climb the wrong mountain.  As I'm reflecting on my progress, I'm frustrated because I'm not where I thought I'd be.
	• I haven't given the process enough time to work.  Progress isn't linear and it's easy to get frustrated when results of effort aren't visible.
	• I'm working on things poorly.  Bad practice leads to middling results.  Good practice leads to perfection.

# Working on the Wrong Things
In Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, Steven Covey relates a story of two groups of producers who are working they're we through a jungle.  A leader is the one who climbs a tree, surveys the entire situation, and shouts "Wrong Jungle".  Managers respond by saying "But, we're making progress."  According to Covey, "Effectiveness - often even survival - does not depend solely on how much effort we expand, but on whether or not the effort we spend is in the right jungle."

My health reports should be viewed as signals; understanding what the signals mean is important.  I'm confident they aren't telling me to exercise less.  According to the American Heart Association, people who exercise at least 150 minutes a week materially reduce their risk of heart disease.

That said, exercise alone may not be enough.  According to (CNET)[https://www.cnet.com/health/fitness/how-to-get-a-six-pack-with-diet-and-exercise/], "No matter how strong your ab muscles are, they're not going to show through unless you have a low enough body fat."  Body fat results from eating a calorie surplus - the excess calories get stored as body fat.  The last time I made significant progress at reducing my body fat was when I tracked my meals via MyFitnessPal.  Working from home means I take less steps and I'm surrounded by food.  Even when I'm exerting some self-control, it's easy for me to unconsciously run a calorie surplus.  

The message I'm hearing from my health reports is that I need to track what I eat.

# Progress isn't Linear
People imagine progress as  a straight line up and to right.  As time marches, you make steady progress towards the goal.  The reality is much of different because the journey to success is full of learning.  What works?  What doesn't?  In addition, we live in complex systems and things outside of control can have affect.  Are there new stressors?

I've learned that instead of measuring progress as achievement to a goal, it's better to measure learning.  Life is an experiment, if you learn from the shots you take you will eventually make a basket.  Further signal doesn't always mean insight.  For example, I'm obviously frustrated with my cardiovascular health.  If I took that signal to mean that I should dramatically change my work out - I may creating more damage than benefit.  After all, doing something imperfect consistently is more likely to result in progress than doing the perfect thing occasionally. 

Ed Camult shares in Creativity that Pixar has a maxim "Trust the Process".  While Ed's talking about the process that Pixar setup for story review, I think can be applied to any process that follows the scientific method.  Learning is the outcome of observing, forming a hypothesis, running an experiment, and submitting for a peer review.  That type of process helps you learn which makes you better at what you pursue over a long enough time.

Maybe I haven't been at this long enough.  In fact, after I've made the changes to my diet I found that my HRV scores recently have doubled!  Implementing small changes from learnings can result in progress.  

# Bad Practice
In Peak, Anders Erickson relates a story of how we learn.  When we want to learn a new skill like Tennis, we practice until it becomes automatic.  While we still have weaknesses, we stop improving because we aren't deliberate.  We're practicing things we're good at rather than what our weaknesses are.  To overcome this obstacle, Erickson states it's important to have well defined goals.

I certainly am not a professional weight lifter or cyclist.  It very well could be that I'm not seeing health improvements because I'm not doing the right activities.  For example, my cycling time hasn't materially improved over the last year.  Likewise, I'm lifting a bit less weight than I used to lift two years ago.  I probably could get better outcomes if I saw a personal trainer.  

My goal isn't to be professional cyclist or lifter.  Instead, I want to increase my health span and do more of what I enjoy.  To that end, I am partnering with a physician who specialized in precision health.  I think they'll be able to help me understand if it would be worthwhile to invest in a trainer or if a different experiment is more promising.  My first appointment is February 6th.
