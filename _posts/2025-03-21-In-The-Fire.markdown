excerpt: "Over the past few months, I have struggled to understand my daughter Abby’s pain—her self-harm, her withdrawal from church, and her false accusations against Missy. Through counseling, I’ve realized that Abby carries deep guilt and believes she is unworthy of love and redemption, while I struggle with trust. A recent session taught me to assume positive intent and lead with feelings, a lesson that is both challenging and necessary. A trip to Big Bend reminded me how much I need God’s guidance, and reflecting on Christ’s Passion helped me see that, despite my frustration, I must rise and keep going. Small steps—open conversations, counseling, and clearer boundaries—are leading us forward, even when the path ahead remains uncertain. Above all, I trust in God’s will to guide us."

# Lord, I Am Not Worthy
"Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but only say the word, and my soul shall be healed."

It has been a while since I’ve written. Writing helps me think—it matters even if no one else reads it. So rather than writing to my children, Lord, I will write to You. I hope that by focusing on my relationship with You, I will also find the words I need for them. Now more than ever, I need to be a vessel of Your grace in my family.

I know You have been with me. Even in the past few months, when everything has felt like fire and I have fallen into despair, You have never left. I see Your presence in the kindness of friends and colleagues, in the believers and non-believers alike who have encouraged me to slow down, breathe, and trust in You. I don’t understand Your plans, but I believe You are calling me to follow You—even through this. And I will try.

# The Trials of Love
In my last reflection, I wrote about my daughter Abby’s struggles. In September, she began cutting. In October, she stopped attending church. And then in March, she reported Missy to Child Protective Services, claiming her self-harm was the result of abuse.

I have spent a great deal of time trying to understand all of this. A few painful truths have emerged:
1. Abby carries deep guilt and shame over her lies.
2. The biggest lie she believes is that she is unworthy of love, forgiveness, and redemption.
3. I judge Abby because I don’t trust her.

I remind myself that she is still a teenager. Her brain is still developing, and her creativity—something I have always admired in her—sometimes manifests in exaggerations. Writing, especially through texting, can make emotions feel less real, which may be why her words sometimes spiral into exaggeration.

Yesterday, we had a counseling session where Abby shared something important: she feels that in the past, when she voiced challenges—like being bullied—she wasn’t heard. She also feels that when she’s expressed desires for change within the family, she’s been ignored. When I asked for examples, Missy interrupted, and Abby shut down. But with the counselor’s help, we re-engaged.

We left with a simple but powerful assignment: assume positive intent and lead with feelings.

To lead with feelings means that when someone shares something with me, I must first acknowledge how they feel before I respond. This is harder than it sounds.

# The Weight of Trust and the Grace of Small Steps
I left that session feeling both tired and hopeful. Prior to it, Missy and I had taken a long weekend to Big Bend National Park. Being away from church that Sunday reminded me how much I need You. The way Missy looks to counselors for grounding, I look to You and the Church. You reorient my values and help me see clearly. When You are not at my center, life becomes complicated and frustrating.

During our trip, we learned that Abby had been texting inappropriately with her friends. I was angry. We decided to come home early. Before returning to the house, Missy and I stopped at the church. The doors were locked, but we walked the Stations of the Cross outside. As I reflected on the times You stumbled during Your Passion, I was struck by one thing: You always rose again.

That moment gave me clarity. You are with me in this trial, just as You were in Yours.

When we got home, Missy and I spoke with Abby about the texts. We had intended to ground her, but after a long discussion, we found a better approach:
- She agreed to be more intentional about texting.
- She committed to being fully present in counseling.
- We decided to move to a parental control app that allows for more nuanced boundaries.

Small steps, but meaningful ones.

# Trusting the Unknown Path
Since then, Abby has honored her commitments—communicating better in counseling, thinking more before she texts. I think we are seeing each other more clearly than we have in a long time. There is still a long way to go, and I don’t fully understand the path ahead.

But I trust You, Lord. Please guide us.

Above all things, Your will.

*Amen.*
