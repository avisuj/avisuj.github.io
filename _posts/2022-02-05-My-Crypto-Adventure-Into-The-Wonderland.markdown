I bought my helium hotspot of June of 2019.  Branded as the people's network, Helium promised to allow people to mine crypto currency via a proof coverage system.  By keeping your miner online, you were rewarded with roughly $3/day in the crypto currency HNT.  In addition, Helium used a small portion of the bandwidth from you home internet to power a LoraWAN network that provided connectivity for IoT devices.  To me this seemed like a great trade; I pay for more bandwidth than I need and by participating in the Helium Network I'm providing connectivity for the IoT revolution without requiring the construction of a new tower.  In 2021 the crypto market experienced a sustained boom.  In September 2021, I was able to sell 2935 HNT for $70,000 USD.  

I opened a Coinbase account in January 2014 after I was told about bitcoin from a coworker.  I didn't understand it, but it had some value and I was curious.  And so I did what I do when I'm curious, I got my hands dirty.  I invested $100/month in bitcoin up until January 2015 collecting nearly 3BTC.  In January, I discovered a website that would let you lend BTC.  I was highly interest in understanding more about microloans so I participated as a lender providing unsecured loans until April 2016.  By the time I was done with the lending experiment I was left with 1.5BTC.  Since I don't like to lose money; I lost interest.  

In November 2017, the price of bitcoin skyrocketed turning my $1400 investment into $16,000.  Once again interested, I turned to mining.  I ended up buying 10 litecoin miners which I put into my garage.  I quickly learned about the challenges of mining: proof of work miners are loud, hot, and consume lots of energy.  That summer I had to install sound-proofing in my garage to try to minimize the hum of fans that I used to keep the miners cool.  The sound proofing made my garage hotter, which eventually resulted in some of my equipment getting damaged.  In March 2018, when my mining experiment ended, I had invested roughly $12,000 of my earnings in mining equipment which I ended up selling for parts worth roughly $2,000.  In addition, I had mined $3,500 in litecoin.

From 2014 - 2017, I had learned:
- Unsecured lending with highly volatile assets is extremely risky.
- Besides being inconvenient, proof of work mining really burned through electricity.
- Through technology, you could leverage crypto currency to participate in financial markets in new ways.

When the helium miner came out, I jumped back in because I saw that mining was evolving.  I was happy to trade excess bandwidth for the opportunity to make a little coin.  After I sold in September 2021, I also began to research different ways to reinvest into the market.  Just as mining had evolved, I discovered decentralized finance had evolved to now provide investment opportunities as a trade facilitator, a startup investor, a collateralized lender and much more.  In 2021, [Dappradar](https://dappradar.com/blog/category/reports) tracked 116,000 tokens across 42 block chains - each representing a unique value proposition.  **I believe in crypto currency because I think it unlocks new economic opportunities that would otherwise be outside my reach.**  In fact, I think the easiest way to understand the dizzying modern landscape of crypto is to understand what those opportunities are.  For example, my current portfolio looks like:

| Decentralized Finance Opportunity | Centralized Finance Parallel | My Current Allocation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mining - Proof of Resource | Sell a Product/Commodity | 10% |
| Infrastructure | Own the Federal Reserve |  65% |
| Automated Market Maker | Own the New York Stock Exchange | 5% |
| OHM Forks / Nodes | Own an Investment Fund | 10% |

## Proof of Resource Mining
As crypto has evolved from Proof of Work; any computing resource besides memory can now be traded for coin:

| Category | Examples | How It Works |
| --- | --- | --- |
| File Storage | [Filecoin](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/filecoin) | Run Software on a computer |
| Network | [Helium](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/helium) and [MXC](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/mxc) | Connect an appliance to your home network |
| Compute | [BTC](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin) | Run software on a computer |

Because I'm intensely lazy - I really like the Network model.  Currently, I have a Helium and an MXC appliance at my home generating roughly $20/day in coin.  In addition, I've invested in MXC options to leverage mined MXC Coin to mint a sister coin [DHX](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/datahighway).

I view mining as different than the other forms of investment because the real world connection tends to lower risk.  Since file storage, network, and compute have utility, the coins associated with them transfer real value in an exchange.  

## Infrastructure
The primary way to gain on Infrastructure coins is from coin appreciation and gain from staking (similar to interest).

The majority of the tokens that are traded in crypto represent smart contracts on specific blockchains.  Blockchains are the core infrastructure of crypto currency.  There are two types of block chains.  [Layer 1](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/fiat/layer-1-blockchain-tokens-everything-you-need-to-know-421499824684903155) chains provide a mechanism for: transaction security, transaction consensus, and transaction reporting.  [Layer 2](https://learn.bybit.com/blockchain/blockchain-layer-1-vs-layer-2) chains build on Layer 1 chains in an effort to increase scale and reduce cost.  

Each individual blockchain has a unique coin that's used to facilitate financial transactions.  For example, if you trade on the Ethereum network every trade will require a little bit of Ethereum to process.  The more apps on Ethereum, the more trades happen.  As trade volume increases, people need more Ethereum for processing.  As people need more Ethereum, Ethereum becomes more expensive.  

The cost of transactions has led to the explosion of blockchains as different organizations strive to find the most efficient, secure, and reliable way to process transactions.  I currently actively participate in five networks:
- Ethereum (L1) - $20.00/transaction
- Avalanche (L1) - $0.50/transaction
- Fantom (L1) - $0.50/transaction
- Godwoken (L2) - $0.00/transaction
- DHX (L2) - pending launch

I think this space is interesting because there are definite economies of scale that will eventually lead to consolidation.  The consolidation pressure is somewhat mitigated through efforts around compatibility; Ethereum, Avalanche, Fantom, and Godwoken are all compatible with <https://metamask.com>.  I think that means there's enough room for more than one block chain but I think it's likely that application developers will consolidate to handful; much like most client applications are written for iOS, Android, or Windows.

## Automated Market Maker
Gains from [Automated Market Maker](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/automated-market-maker-amm) tokens come from transaction fees and coin appreciation.

Automated Market Makers are exchanges that individuals use to trade tokens.  In addition to the fee that's charged by block chain, the exchange also charges a fee.  People who provide liquidity to the exchange receive a portion of that fee typically in the exchanges reward token.  

Providing liquidity can be tricky; there are some tokens that will pay exchanges extra boosting rewards.  These boosts are often short term and are often provided by tokens that are depreciating.  Since you have to hold a specific token in order to provide liquidity, it's very easy to lose money if the token depreciates quickly.

As a general rule, decide what tokens you want to hold and then strive to increase yield by providing those tokens to exchanges.

## OHM Forks / Nodes
Gains from [OHM Forks](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/ohm-fork) and Nodes are made from the appreciation of the coin associated with the application.

OHM Forks, Nodes, and even some NFT's now are owned-treasury protocols.  These applications have assets and a balance sheet like a typical company.  The earnings from assets are typically reinvested creating a virtuous of growing the treasury.  These applications grow treasury balances by encouraging more people to invest, by investing in other applications, or by providing liquidity for automated market makers. 

Unlike stocks, many of the application's lack material cash flow.  As a result most valuations are based on ratio of total assets.  In addition, just because an application has assets; that doesn't mean those assets will be distributed to the application's coin holders.  Faith that the treasury value can be realized is heavily tied into the market value of these applications.

## TLDR;
The decentralization inherent within crypto currency allows more people to participate in all aspects of the financial value chain.  By making participation broader, crypto has the promise to unlock increased innovation from people who otherwise would have been frozen out of the market by a competitive moat in the centralized finance system.  I think that is going to create unique opportunities for investment for some time to come.
