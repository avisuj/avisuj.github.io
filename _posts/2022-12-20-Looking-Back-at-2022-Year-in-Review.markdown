# Overview
I wouldn't do 2022 differently, but there are definitely some changes I want to take into 2023.  Over the year, we made some great memories.  Financially, we were even with the market.  Given the market stress and significant one time expenses, I'm impressed with how our new budgeting system is working.  I wish we would have adopted it sooner.  

Professionally, I couldn't be happier with the job move into Patient experience.  I'm hopeful that the work I've put in will become visible through customer success communicated via case studies shortly.  I feel like I'm making a difference.

Going forward to 2023, I'm going to watch what I eat more carefully.  In addition, we need to be more accountable to our travel budget.  This year was ok, I hope next year is even better.

# Notable Events
- European Vacation - This year we went on amazing vacation through central Europe.  We were able to cross ten cities and eleven countries by train.  Notable memories include: a gondola in Venice, an opera in Prague, and the Ann Frank House.  
- Thanksgiving Vacation - We visited the Grand Canyon with Missy's parents.  It was the first time the kids got to see the Grand Canyon.  Afterwards, we spent a few days in Huntington Beach by the Ocean.
- Passing of Todd Fujawa - Todd's a friend.  His daughter and Abby are friends.  His sudden passing was a surprise that hit too close to home.  
- Death of Hedwig - Missy totaled our Chrysler Pacifica and we ended up purchasing another one.

# Wellness
On the year, I've gained 12 pounds while I've lost 2" around my waist.  I was 25% more active than last year contributing to increased muscle mass.  At the same token, I'm approaching my 2018 weight.  My health markers reflect it: 
- My cholesterol and lipid levels are as high as 2018.
- My resting heart beat has increased three beats per minute.
- My fitness level score decreased by two points.

For 2023, I need to get my weight under control.  As such, I'm restarting logging my food.  If I want to eat it, I need to log it.

# Finances
This year the bubble burst.  In addition, we spent $74K more than last year.  In total, we lost 15% of our net worth.  

Our top three spending categories:
- $54K Automotive - replacing a car
- $43K Taxes - underpayment on last year
- $38K Travel - $13K over budget

Ignoring the above spending categories, expenses were within expectations.  

I think it's also important to view 2022 in context of the broader market.  The benchmarks of SPY and CoinGecko were down 20% and 62% respectively.  Broadly, our investments asset classes performed at par with benchmarks.  As a result of the bear market, our investments have been concentrated in stock equities.  In addition passive income is only slightly growing.  Getting to a balanced ratio is going to take intentional saving.  

A notable success is that our credit card balances were low throughout the year.  The new budgeting system I've put in place that forecasts episodic expenses and saves for them via dedicated accounts has proven to be remarkably successful.  I think prepaying our expenses is the heart of "pay yourself first" and really helped improve our resiliency throughout the year.  

# Sustainability
- Our electricity usage was flat at 21,500 kWh.  Excluding AC, the largest consumers were dehumidifier, car, and garage fan.  Going forward, we're going to use the dehumidifier and garage fan less.
- Our natural gas usage was flat at 390 CCF.
