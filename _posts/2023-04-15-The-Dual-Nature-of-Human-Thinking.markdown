excerpt: "The blog post discusses the concept of "Giving an A" from the book "The Art of Possibility" by Rosamund Stone Zander and Benjamin Zander, and how it relates to the dual modes of thinking in the brain. Embracing both fast, intuitive, and emotional thinking and slower, deliberative, and logical thinking is important for learning and growth."

I am currently reading the Art of Possibility by Rosamund Stone Zander, a counselor, and Benjamin Zander, a conductor and teacher.  They talk about two selves: the measuring self and the full self. The measuring self is concerned with how you compare to others and how you measure up to external standards. The full self is concerned with your own internal standards and values.  They provide 12 practices such as "It's all invented", "Giving an A", and "The Way Things Are" that can help you change your perspective in order to see new possibilities.

Over Easter, I related how Mr. Zander manifested his practice of "Giving an A" at New England Conservatory of Music by literally giving his students an A in exchange for a detailed paper describing what they did to deserve an A - an exercise that forces the students to articulate thier internal goals are.  His point is that the measuring self can be limiting.  In a similar way, Carol Dweck describes the concept of mindset and how it affects our lives.  Her book, Mindset, argues that people have either a fixed mindset or a growth mindset. A fixed mindset is one in which people believe that their abilities are fixed and cannot be changed. A growth mindset is one in which people believe that their abilities can be developed through hard work and dedication. The book argues that people with a growth mindset are more likely to succeed in life because they are more willing to take risks and learn from their mistakes.

Yet when I found myself taking about Art of Possibility - I found myself hedging the explanation.  Maybe "Giving an A" only applied when you were dealing with top performers, like musicians studying at the New England Conservatory of Music.  "Giving an A" is about believing the best about the other people you interact with.  When we believe the best about others we open ourselves up to their feedback, that feedback gives us opportunities to learn, learning helps us embrace new possibilities.  Indeed, it's similar to the idea of rejecting victim stories presented in Thanks for Feedback by Douglas Stone and Sheila Heen.  A victim story makes us out to be innocent sufferers in the predicament while a villain story helps us justify any negative action we take toward the other by attributing evil or malicious motives. In order to receive feedback, we have to realize that they arenâ€™t villains  

It seems like then the concept has broad application.  So why did I hedge?

The more I read about human psychology, the more impressed I am with how brain operates in dual modes.  In Thinking Fast and Slow, Daniel Kahneman describes two systems that drive the way we think: System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical.  While both modes have purpose, sometimes we are aerved in intentionally shifting the mode we are in.  Tying back to the Art of Possibility:  I see the calculating self as deliberative and logical and the full self as intuitive and emotional.  The Art of Possibility then is making the case that to embrace possibility we have to shift our state to System 1.

I believe that there are times when it makes sense to embrace our intuitive and emotional self.  Yet while I was related the story, I found myself wondering is it really fair to give everyone an A?

Fairness, like many amorphous topics, is multifaceted and includes: 
- Consistency: A decision is considered fair if it is consistent with established rules, norms, and procedures. If a decision is arbitrary or made on the basis of personal biases, it may be considered unfair.
- Impartiality: A decision is considered fair if it is made without bias or prejudice towards any particular individual or group. This means that the decision-maker must be neutral and objective, and must not favor one group or individual over another.
- Transparency: A decision is considered fair if the decision-making process is transparent and open to scrutiny. This means that the decision-maker must be willing to explain their reasoning and provide clear justifications for the decision.
- Accessibility: A decision is considered fair if it is accessible to all affected parties. This means that all parties must have equal access to information and resources that are relevant to the decision.
- Consequences: A decision is considered fair if its consequences are distributed fairly and equitably among all affected parties. This means that the decision should not disproportionately benefit or harm any particular individual or group.
- Participation: A decision is considered fair if all affected parties have the opportunity to participate in the decision-making process. This means that all parties must have the opportunity to express their views and have their voices heard.

"Giving an A" is inconsistent with how I understand school triggering my concern.  At the same time, it met every other criteria.  In the end, the process appeared to result in better outcomes for the students in the class.  Sometimes, I think we need to break the rules in order to get out of the box that we are in.  In this scenario, trying to help students to embrace their mastery, "Giving an A" makes sense.  

In reflection, I think:
- We work in two ways: fast intuitive and emotional AND slower, deliberative and logical.  
- When we are trying to explore the unknown, our intuitive and emotional self can help us hear feedback.  
- When we are trying to improve, our slower deliberative and logical self can help us process feedback.  
- By integrating both processes and embracing mistakes, we learn.  
- We should be mindful of how our actions affect others.

I ultimately hedged because it's not always right to "Give an A".  Sometimes it's important to be able to measure performance to get a picture of the way things are so that you can improve.  Likewise, sometimes it's important to set that aside so you can break through to the next level.
