excerpt: "This week, my wife shared her hesitation about joining OCIA—her honest struggle with Church teachings left her feeling more rejected than invited. At the same time, my daughter’s quiet anger and distance left me feeling helpless as a father. In this prayer, I reflect on how these moments shook my assumptions about faith, control, and love. I’m learning to sit with unanswered questions, to lead with compassion, and to trust that God is present—even in the silence, even in the ache."

Lord,

Last night Missy opened her heart to me. She shared her hesitation about joining OCIA—not because of disbelief, but because some teachings of the Church leave her feeling unwelcome. She wrestles deeply with ideas like the lost books of the Bible, priestly celibacy, and Mary’s perpetual virginity. She worries these differences mean she’s excluded, that faith alone isn’t enough without perfect alignment.

Her words shook something loose inside me.

I’ve always held that truth matters. Faith, for me, is grounded in something real, solid, and unchanging. But listening to her, I didn’t hear defiance—I heard sorrow. I heard someone earnestly seeking You, yet afraid the Church might not embrace her as she is. And I couldn’t help but ask myself: If my approach to faith makes my own wife feel outside Your love, have I misunderstood something essential?

Have I confused conviction with control? Have I unintentionally made acceptance conditional?

Forgive me, Lord.

Abby, too, has been struggling this week. She's carrying anger and distance, and I don’t know why. I sense her pain, yet feel powerless to heal it. I want to protect her, to fix what’s hurting her—but instead, I’m standing helplessly, unsure what to do. It’s a heavy weight.

Amidst this uncertainty, I’ve been reading Interior Freedom. The words in chapters two and three stopped me in my tracks. They reminded me suffering isn't something to be escaped but something to embrace, even welcome. Our lives, our faith, aren’t defined by the absence of pain but by our response to it. True freedom isn’t control; it's love.

So here I am, Lord.

I don't have answers. I can’t easily close the gaps or dispel the doubts. But I can choose to show up. I can offer unconditional love. I can trust that You are at work even in the places beyond my reach, redeeming situations I don’t yet fully understand.

I trust that You haven't abandoned us. You're molding me through silence, through waiting, through heartache.

Teach me humility and courage in this truth.
Teach me to listen more and speak less.
Teach me to reflect Your heart—
a heart that gracefully holds truth,
that embraces people exactly where they are,
and gently guides them toward the light.

I love my family deeply, Lord. May my life make that clear.

I trust in Your ways.
You lead me to green pastures—
to places of rest when my spirit is weary,
beside still waters when the world feels overwhelming,
along paths of righteousness when I’ve lost direction.

Even in shadowed valleys, when Your purpose isn't clear to me,
You are present.
You comfort me.
You prepare a place for me amid uncertainty.

Your goodness and mercy follow me, even now.
And I know I will dwell in Your presence all the days of my life.

Amen.
